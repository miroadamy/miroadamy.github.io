<p>So, after few days working diskless, I am back to normal operation mode. About time, we are late with last episode of screencast ...</p>
<p>The copying of external disk went error free and took almost 5 hours (210 GB). Fortunately, the MBP was usable - I did not want to modify too many files, but it was perfect for Web research and writing in Google Docs.</p>
<p>After reboot, the TimeMachine decided that 85 GB needs to be backed up again. This seems like bug in TimeMachine, because I have not really changed much more than few gigs - 4-5 max during the few days.</p>
<p>Spotlight is also quite busy and completely confused - saying that I need to wait over minus two billion hours until it is done with indexing. That's pretty long - or pretty fast, depending how you see it :-)</p>
