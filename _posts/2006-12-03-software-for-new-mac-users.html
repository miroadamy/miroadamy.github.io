<p>It's been almost 5 months now since I started to use Mac OS-X. During these months, I became very comfortable in the new environment and albeit I do not consider being a power user, I can do all I need with my Macbook and use it daily.</p>
<p>Today I found out that yet another from my friends got a Mac. Great news, Thomas - hope you will enjoy your Macbook Pro as much as myself, Gabo and many others. Welcome in the club.</p>
<p>As promissed, here is a quick list of the software I found useful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neooffice.org/"><strong>NeoOffice</strong></a> - Cocoa port of OpenOffice. All you need to interoperate with business world - excellent compatibility with Microsoft office formats. I had never any issues reading Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents from Windows. We use OpenOffice in business since September and it works really fine. NeoOffice uses same engine, but user interface is not based on X-Windows (as it would be for Linux and other Unix distribution), but is Mac native. Free, GPL, great looking and works like charm. Highly recommended.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/"><strong>Adium</strong></a> - free instant messaging application for Mac OS X that can connect to AIM, MSN, Jabber, Yahoo. No voice chat available (yet).<br />
<a href="http://chmox.sourceforge.net/"><strong>CHmox</strong></a> - http://chmox.sourceforge.net/ - native viewer for CHM format (Microsoft Compiled Help) for OS-X. Mission critical app for eBook fans. Not sure if it is the typography, but even MSDN Magazine looks so much nicer on Mac :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://aquamacs.org/"><strong>Aquamacs</strong></a> Emacs - "the Allmighty Editor"in Aqua version. 'nough said.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/"><strong>Delicious Library</strong></a> - book and DVD management program. Not free, but worth every penny - fantastic!</p>
<p><a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/"><strong>iTerm</strong></a> - very nice terminal</p>
<p><a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/librarybooks"><strong>Library Books</strong></a> - menulet that reminds me to return books to local library.</p>

<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/"><strong>QuickSilver</strong></a> - Hard to describe in one sentence, but very useful. Officially, it is a launcher. In reality, more like Swiss Army Chainsaw :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Graphics/ViewIt.shtml"><strong>ViewIt</strong></a> - image viewer</p>
