<p>As the September 28th is approaching (the day when the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod touch</a> will be available in Canada), I have a real dilemma: do I go with the "iPhone without the phone" or not ? The price $329 for 8 GB iPod is pretty high - compared to $279 for 80GB classic - which would allow me to carry all my music, some movies and all podcasts with me. On the other hand, the Touch has WiFi and can be used as pretty decent Web browser on top of iPod functionality.</p>
<p>What will be the decision point for me is probably how good or bad is this device for reading eBooks - as I am real eBook junkie :-). HTML books should not be an issue (Safari), the real question is how the PDF will look like. According <a href="http://wowio.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/iphone-and-ebooks-the-video/" target="_blank">this video</a>, reading PDF on iPhone should be fairly OK and iPod touch is  same or better ...<br />
And according to this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Subjectively, the iPhone’s display is clearly superior to any computer display I’ve ever seen. While this is a function of many factors, the high pixel density plays a huge part in creating the extraordinarily tack-sharp perception" </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm, that sounds very good. Reading is all about display - the better screen, the more fun. Especially when you use properly formatted PDF - you can go for example to <a href="http://www.feedbooks.com/" target="_blank">FeedBooks</a> and use the PDF formatted for Sony PRS 500. It will certainly not offer Sony's battery life (it lasted for almost 2 weeks during my holiday) or readability in a bright sun ... but the screen and UI should make it up.</p>
<p>Let's hope that the hack allowing install Skype (and other apps) and run it on iPod touch will come soon :-). If that happens, that's good enough reason for buying it - OS-X in a pocket ...</p>
