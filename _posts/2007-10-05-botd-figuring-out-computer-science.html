<p>It is all about deep questions and problems computer science. Including the question whether such thing as computer <strong>science</strong> <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~alan/workingnotes/AC65.pdf" target="_blank">actually exists</a>. I thing it does, but have occasional moments of doubts - mostly when I read something related to real science :-).</p>
<p>What does Andreas Zwinkau (it is read as ts-win-cow, my anglophone friends ;-)) think about it, can be found <a href="http://focs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://focs.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>His comments are amazingly deep for such a young guy. I wish when I was getting my comp-sci degree (1981-1986) we have had the same wonderful things these young fellas have now: ubiquitous internet and really world wide web with Google that actually makes it useful, Linux and many other wonderful open source projects (Apache, Jakarta, Firefox, Eclipse - you name it). Can you imagine studying computer science in a world where the Web does not exist (yet) ?</p>
