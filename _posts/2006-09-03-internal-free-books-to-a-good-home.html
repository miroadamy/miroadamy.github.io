<p>Again, I need to make some space on a shelf and I simply cannot throw away a book ... This time I have decided to reduce my Java bookshelf to allow new (mostly .NET books) come in. No, I am not abandoning Java - but for next 8-12 months I am very likely fully booked in .NET projects, and after that, it will be time to upgrage to new sets of books for Java 1.6 anyway ...</p>
<p>If you are interested, send me an email. You can pick the books in one of our offices - either downtown or new one @ Terry Fox.  <a href="http://www.thinknostic.com/">Thinknostic</a>  people have first chance to select, but this offer is not limited to Thinknosticker's - so if you know me and have a friend who may be interested, feel free to fwd this email.</p>
<p>Same as last time, I will donate unclaimed books to Ottawa public library. I plan to get rid of it before September 18th, so we have about two weeks.</p>
<p>The list of the books is <a href="http://www.writely.com/View.aspx?docid=dt9pwg5_23c37f2n">here</a>.</p>
