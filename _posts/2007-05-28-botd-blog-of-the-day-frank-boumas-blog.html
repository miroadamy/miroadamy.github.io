<p>A brief look at my Google Reader subscription list made me aware that I have added to my reading list a loooot of blogs, newslist and so on. Unfortunately, they are not organized very well and should be properly placed into folders. In a process of doing that, I will put some of the interesting blogs here.</p>
<p>For today, it is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/default.aspx" target="_blank">Frans Bouma's blog</a> - focusing on .NET and Microsoft technology platforms. From the most recent good articles, look at why <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2007/05/21/api-s-and-production-code-shouldn-t-be-designed-by-scientists.aspx" target="_blank">API's should not be designed by scientists</a> - discussing and comparing various ways how the database level paging is handled in various databases (MySQL, PostgreSql, DB2, Oracle, SS2005), or read Frans' comments on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2007/05/21/api-s-and-production-code-shouldn-t-be-designed-by-scientists.aspx" target="_blank">Entity Framework</a> being cut from .NET 3.5 - which is sad, but IMHO fairly accurate summary of the recent development. See for yourself.</p>
