<p>It was Rod who started this by saying how great it is to replace slow typing with faster speaking and mentioning some kind of magical software package (appropriately named <a href="http://www.digitalriver.com/v2.0-img/operations/scansoft/site/html/dragon/Preferred_9.htm">Dragon Naturally Speaking</a>) which does transform your voice to written properly spelled English text with amazing accuracy. I was pretty sceptical, after seeing few years ago similar software from IBM with not-so-great accuracy, and even more recently the famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y_Jp6PxsSQ">Vista speech wreckognition</a>.  Then Peter bought the software as well and had similarly good results as Rod. Now I got really interested. Both Peter and Rod and native speakers of English and I was very curious  how will the software deal with my very own version of English  pronunciation and fairly thick  Slovak accent. So we did try it today.</p>
<p>Result: amazing. This thing works. I had to read for about five minutes of predefined sentences in training mode and during this period the software created "user profile" capturing personal deviations and details about the way I speak. After that I tried to read half page from a book (it was technical book on UML design) and Dragon got whole text correctly except one word. No misspellings, no typos. That's much better result as if I would be trying to retype the paragraph by hand - and certainly much faster.</p>
<p>After that, just for fun I tried to say something not in English. I said something like</p>
<p><em>"Und jetzt werde ich ausprobieren wie es reagiert wenn man auf Deutsch spricht"</em></p>
<p>I am not 100% sure about the exact wording - but it was some German variation on "Now we will try out how it behaves whe I speak German" and here was the amazing result:</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:12pt;">Let's  missed it a software sock and deny Gary tomato salsa and yet in a vendetta  dish<span>.</span></span></em></p>
<p>No, I did not make this up - it is copied from email word by word.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not a fair test, as the software was specifically set to US English. The company sells several language modules - including German, Italian and Dutch - which where not installed. I can imagine the result would be at least as good as with English - because English prononciation is probably most challenging for machine processing (why else would there be 3 separate modules - American English, Brittish English and Indian English). But it was fun anyway</p>
