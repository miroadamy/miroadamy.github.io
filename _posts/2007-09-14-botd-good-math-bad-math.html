<p>Today's BOTD (Blog of the Day) is "Good Math, Bad math".</p>
<p>What it is about is summarized in its subtitle:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Finding the fun in good math. Squashing the bad math and the fools who promote it. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>There is no need to add anything to this.</p>
<p>Only maybe an URL: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" target="_blank">http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/</a></p>
