<p>After carrying in my pocket for 3 days, I have decided to get something to prevent my smallest Mac from scratches and breaking when drops (I did drop the iPod touch and it was close call: one of the edges was scratched and slightly damaged).</p>
<p>It took some time to decide, but at the end I settled for this one:</p>
