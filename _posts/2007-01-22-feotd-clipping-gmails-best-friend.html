<ul>
<li>Thanks to Lifehacker I have discovered this extension which add missing piece of GMail functionality:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>This very simple extension allows you to enter multiple sets of text (such as e-mail signatures) and paste them into forms simply by right-clicking.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this such a big deal ? I am using GMail for both my personal and work stuff. To make sure my work related email appear as coming from company email address, I set the proper From address when composing an email. GMail can be configured to stay with the recipient address when replying. The only problem is signature. In private emails, I want to have link to the blog, in work emails, to company site. And GMail offers only one signature. With this extension, I do not use any signature from GMail, just simply insert correct one from the Clippings buffer.</p>
<p>There are other solutions <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/greasemonkey/download-of-the-day-gmail-multiple-signatures-greasemonkey-script-211123.php">Gmail multiple signatures Greasemonkey script</a> but they are quite heavyweight for simple problem (which was main reason I did not try them out).</p>
<p>Get it at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1347/">usual place</a>.</p>
