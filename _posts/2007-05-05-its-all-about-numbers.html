<p>Imagine if somebody got copyright on a number 32. You could not say any more on a Web page that you use 32 bit OS because you were not allowed to use the number.  You could not even write thirty two, or 0x20... Could not send a card for 32nd birthday. Sounds crazy, right ?</p>
<p>But exactly this is happening. Somebody is trying to claim exclusive ownership of one number and sending take-down letters, law threats to those you have it posted on their web sites or blogs.</p>
<p>This is so wrong. Nobody can restrict usage of a number. Any number. Numbers cannot be copyrighted. Not even primes. Not even a really big numbers. Not even the number, like 41425871524967055159433955941880327 * 320.</p>
<p>Numbers are above politics and corporate lawyers. Above DRM and patents.<br />
Numbers are free speech. Maybe the last real free speech remaining  ...</p>
<p>If the above does not really make any sense, maybe <a href="http://www.09f911029d74e35bd84156c5635688c0.ws/" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">this</a> will shed some light ...</p>
