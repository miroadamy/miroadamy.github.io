<p>in case you have not noticed - Interface21 aka SpringSource (great name change, btw) runs a <a href="http://blog.interface21.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> with lots of hidden treasures inside.</p>
<p>Recent article describes new addition to Spring portfolio which is territory within my "watched space": enterprise integration. See the <a href="http://blog.interface21.com/main/2007/12/14/spring-integration-a-new-addition-to-the-spring-portfolio/" target="_blank">blog entry</a> for more.<a href="http://blog.interface21.com/main/2007/12/14/spring-integration-a-new-addition-to-the-spring-portfolio/" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>If you are in corporate space that is keen on "standards", the <a href="http://blog.interface21.com/main/2007/11/09/a-response-to-ejb-3-and-spring-comparative-analysis/" target="_blank">comparison of Spring vs EJB3</a> is very good article as well. Not that EJB would matter too much these days (IMHO) - but a nice read nevertheless.</p>
<p>Recommended.</p>
