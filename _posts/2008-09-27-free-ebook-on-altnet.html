<p>It is always a nice surprise to find something that is free and actually useful on the Net :-). Like this one: a fellow Ottawan <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/about.aspx" target="_blank">Karl Sequin</a> wrote and generously made available as free download <a href="http://codebetter.com/files/folders/codebetter_downloads/entry179694.aspx" target="_blank">"Foundations of programming"</a> eBook.</p>
<p>He touches many topics of various levels from high level design concepts (dependency injection) to low level "Back to Basics" - how memory allocation and pointers work. Especially the later is often neglected and overlooked (and consequently misunderstood) by younger developers who started their education with a garbage collected language such as Java or C# and never were exposed to beauty and horrors of C ;-)</p>
<p>The book is using .NET and C# as platform, but the applicability of the chapters goes way beyond the Windows or Microsoft world. After all, Alt.Net has very close relations with Java world.</p>
<p>If you have time, give it a look. Were it not free, I would say it is worth every penny. Now I can only say it is definitely worth the time you spend on it.</p>
<p>Thanks Karl, I hope I'll meet you in person sometimes. The advantage of living in Ottawa is that you have lots of smart people around you :-).</p>
