<p>Thought of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>... Too much to learn. Too much bandwidth crowding the channels of communication. We can’t listen fast enough. We’re left standing on our tiptoes all the time</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Greg Bear, The Darwin's Radio</em></p>
<p>This does not sound very optimistic, which is quite representative. I am down with bad headache, cannot really think straight, spending time sleeping, reading a book (above) and  surfing the Web.<br />
I found out that I made it to <a href="http://ottawastart.com/blogs.php">Ottawa Blogger's list</a> and learned a new word: <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci1137059,00.html">splogger</a></p>
