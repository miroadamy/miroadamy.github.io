<p>Lured by the iPhone platform, this is what I read in the evenings. Feels kind of funny: after 10+ years of Java/C# and almost as many years  of C++ beforehand, I mostly lost my C instincts and C habits. Fortunately, I have also mostly lost my C++ bad habits as well.</p>
<p>The Apple site is definitive starting point - put the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/index.html</a> into your bookmarks. From non-Apple sources, very bookmarking-worthy is the <a href="http://osx.hyperjeff.net/reference/CocoaArticles.php" target="_blank">Cocoa Literature</a> and <a href="http://www.cocoadevcentral.com/" target="_blank">Cocoa Devcentral</a>.</p>
<p>Theocacao has a <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/510" target="_blank">nice example</a> highlighting diferences between Objective C 1.0 and 2.0. There are many tutorials available, with various depth and quality, e.g. <a href="http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://objc.toodarkpark.net/" target="_blank">here</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> is also quite useful.</p>
<p>From books - I have browsed few in Chapters and on Safari Books, the best still seems to be Hillegass's <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/products/cocoa1.shtml" target="_blank">book</a>. There is an updated version (for Objective C 2.0) coming out in June 2008.</p>
<p>From list of links, try <a href="http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/objective-c/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
