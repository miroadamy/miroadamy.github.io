<p>Few weeks ago, first Foursquare application and then my favorite RunKeeper app started to fail. The symptoms were simple:</p>
<p>1) attempt to start</p>
<p>2) wait for for 2-10 seconds</p>
<p>3) exit</p>
<p>Analysis of the crash logs did not reveal anything obvious (see ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/NAME:</p>

<p>What helped was to delete both applications from the phone, including data and let the iTunes install it back. No data is lost, because both services are cloud based - only minor inconvenience was to re-enter login information.</p>
<p>So, Nael - I am back in the game and cannot wait to claim back mayorships for all places I have been ousted :-)</p>
