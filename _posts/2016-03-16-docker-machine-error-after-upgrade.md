# Fixing docker-machine error after upgrade

I had to upgrade docker toolbox on Yosemite to get latest docker-compose additions. 

After installing the new package, I was not able to connect to docker machine:

```
➜  ~ docker-machine status
Stopped
➜  ~ docker-machine start default
Starting "default"...
(default) Check network to re-create if needed...
(default) Waiting for an IP...
Machine "default" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...

Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.
➜  ~ docker-machine env default
Error checking TLS connection: Error checking and/or regenerating the certs: There was an error validating certificates for host "192.168.99.100:2376": tls: DialWithDialer timed out
You can attempt to regenerate them using 'docker-machine regenerate-certs [name]'.
Be advised that this will trigger a Docker daemon restart which will stop running containers.
```

Regenerating the certificates did not solve the problem. Neither did reboot.

Tried

```
docker-machine --debug regenerate-certs -f default
```

## Fix

What worked for me was dropping and recreating the virtual machine Docker uses to run.

```
➜  ~ docker-machine rm default
About to remove default
Are you sure? (y/n): y
Successfully removed default

➜  ~ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default

To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env default

➜  ~ docker-machine env default
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/miro/.docker/machine/machines/default"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env default)

➜  ~ eval $(docker-machine env default)

➜  ~ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
➜  ~ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

Unfortunate (or fortunate ?) side effect is that all containers and images were blown away and I can start from scratch with lots of free disk space :-)
