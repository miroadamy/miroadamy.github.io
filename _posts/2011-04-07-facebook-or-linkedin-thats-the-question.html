<p>Few weeks ago, I canceled my Twitter account and stopped using Twitter altogether. I do not miss it at all.</p>
<p>The next vector of distraction to be brought under control is Facebook. This is a tougher nut to crack - because of wide variety of people in my circle of friends, Facebook plays many different roles.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a connection to old friends and colleagues from the old continent and old country.</li>
<li>It is a family connection.</li>
<li>It is a connection to people that are not on FB through their friends or relatives that are.</li>
<li>It is a link to people I worked with and wanted to keep in touch.</li>
<li>It is a link to people I share common interest with</li>
</ul>
<p>This variety creates a problem of itself (which is multiplied by English/non English division).  Tool that does too many things, does not do them very well.</p>
<p>Honestly, I do not understand how some people can maintain hundreds of "friends". The group of this size generates so much noise, so many updates that the news stream becomes close to useless. One can always hide updates from most significant  "link spammers" but that opens up a question: is there any point in providing a view into your life to somebody whose updates you do not read anyway ?</p>
<p>First attempt to solve this is to separate the "private world" and work. In my case, there is no clear boundary as I am fortunate to work with so many of my close personal friends (many of which are on FB) and in my current employment I am lucky to consider many of the people I work with to be much more than just work buddies. Nevertheless, my goal is to get down to two digit number of Facebook friends.</p>
<p>To achieve that, I would like to ask some of my current Facebook friends to reconnect on LinkedIn. I absolutely want to stay in touch,  just using different channel.</p>
<p>My public profile is http://www.linkedin.com/in/miroadamy.</p>
<p>See you there</p>
