<blockquote>"Corporate IT is dominated by bloatware. Time and time again we have to deal with expensive software purchased on golf-courses that just get in our way while sucking funds and development hours. Technologies that make it harder<br />
for programmers to do what they like to do best - make a difference for the businesses they are supporting. "</p></blockquote>
