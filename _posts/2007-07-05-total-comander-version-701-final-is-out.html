<p>go and get it - at <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/">http://www.ghisler.com/</a></p>
<p>It got nice visual upgrades - look and feel and icons are gently nicer and more XP-ish. Plus many <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank">other new features</a>. Upgrade is still free for registered users.</p>
<p>If I should pick one single most useful program I ever used on any computer system, Total Commander would be clear winner. I do not remember when exactly I purchased the license - I guess sometimes around 1994-95, when it was named Windows Commander. Since that time, I was using it pretty much every day (except few short periods I was working exclusively on Unix). I still use it every working day (as I often spend weekends on Mac platforms).</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr. Ghisler. As you say in Switzerland - merci vielmals. The 40 Swiss franks spent on the Commander license back then was absolutely the best software purchase of last decade :-).</p>
