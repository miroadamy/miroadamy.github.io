<p>The CHM files (Microsoft compiled HTML help files) are often used for eBooks. They are readable on OS-X using excellent open source CHMOX application. If you want to get more useful preview in OuickView than the not very helpfull static icon, get this plugin.</p>
<p>Download here<br />

</a><br />
How to install it: Unzip it, take the proper package for your system (the ZIP file contains several architectures, on modern Intel-based Mac's you want to use x64), put it inside</p>
<blockquote><p>/System/Library/Quicklook</p></blockquote>
<p>and enjoy !</p>
<p>Big thanks to the developer <a href="https://sourceforge.net/users/qiqian/" target="_blank">Qian Qian</a> - whoever that is.</p>
