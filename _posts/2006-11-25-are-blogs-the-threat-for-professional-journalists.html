<p>Thanks to 6 hours difference, I usually read tomorrow edition of Slovak and Czech newspapers on the Net one day ahead. Most of them switches to new edition at midnight, which is 6PM our time. I am doing this for several years already. What is different between now and 2-3 years ago is what I read. While before it were mostly articles written by journalists  and news industry professionals, now  I read mostly blogs. On <a href="http://blog.sme.sk/">SME blog</a>, there are  few hundreds, maybe few thousands bloggers, and content they produce is usually much more interesting and readable that the content of official newspaper.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it is not only newspapers. If I sum up my information sources from the Net, maybe 70% of it is "user created content" - sites like Wikipedia, social bookmarking sites and aggregators such as diggdot.us, programmer's blogs and programmers sites (SourceForge, CodeProject.com), podcasts - all of them share one common feature: the content is not created by professionals, which are paid to create content.</p>
<p>How far will this continue ? Does this trend present a threat to professional journalists ? How far can these sites grow ? Will they be able to keep the quality and focus ? Is this just a new fad that will disappear - or will it change the landscape of news industry same way as internet changed software distribution or music industry ? What will motivate people to buy paper version of newspaper when you can get much more than you can eventually consume for free online ? How many sites can survive on ad income only - without charging subscription fee for access ? Only time will tell ...</p>
