<p>It happened few times in past few months: using Google to find out what is the time in Bombay or New Delhi, I used the search phrase "India time zone" and got two types of results. One was referring to the India Time zone as UTC+9hrs and the other was giving the <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=176" target="_blank">correct answer</a> - UTC+5:30. I know that whole India is in single time zone and this time zone is 5.5 hours before GMT. What did the UTC+9 mean ?<br />
As I found out, the India in India time zone is not the India as a country, but military spelling of the time zone for letter I. The military uses letters to <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/military/">label time zone</a>, starting with GMT or UTC being the Zero Meridian or Z time zone - spelled as Zulu time. Then going East, the zones go A, B, C - spelled as Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta - up to the letter I which is spelled as India. West from Zulu you start with N, O, P - or November, Oscar, Papa ... Up to March 11 we were living in Romeo time zone, now we moved to Quebec time zone (again, nothing to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" target="_blank"><em>La belle province</em></a>, just spelling of Q)</p>
<p>Btw, the military codes have their own "loopback" or "localhost" - the letter J refers to local time zone :-)</p>
