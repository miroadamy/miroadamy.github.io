# Starting ACC (ATG Control Centre) on OS-X

Copy the installation of ACC for respective version from a Linux VM:

The startup script in bin/startClient will fail, because it cannot determine which Java to use to run the app.

It is trying to determine Unix flavour, failing that defaults to Solaris and ends up with invalid settings.

### Fix

Set the variable JAVA_VM to path to executable command on your system.

```
which java
java is /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_55.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java
java is /usr/bin/java
  
export JAVA_VM=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_55.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java
```

After that, it works.

You can also modify the script to make sure this happens automagically. I have commented out the Solaris default and replaced it with my Java
