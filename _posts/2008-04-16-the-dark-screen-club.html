<p>It happened few days ago for the first time: after opening the lid on my MacBook Pro, the machine woke up, but the screen stayed dark. Whatever I did, I just could see cursor and nothing underneath. I had to resort to unthinkable - reboot :-(</p>
<p>Some research showed this is known problem - which is from certain point of view good, because many people found hopefully many workarounds. The more information can be found <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7009319" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://thelameleopard.wordpress.com/category/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1075638" target="_blank">here</a>. Very helpfull was also <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/pers/MacWakeProblems.html" target="_self">this page</a>.</p>
<p>There are speculations about some software that may be related to the problem. As matter of fact, I have installed after some time of not using it one of the suspects: iStat Pro dashboard widget.</p>
<p>What I have done to minimize chances of reoccurence:</p>
<p>- removed the iStat Pro and Polar Clock screen saver (which was also new install)<br />
- switched off the setting 'Automatically reduce the brightness of the display before sleep'<br />
- started to switch off the bluetooth mouse before closing the lid (so that BT is off when sleeping)</p>
<p>I have also switched off the "safe sleep" mode which is not of much use as my notebook never stays unopened for longer that 12 hours :-).</p>
<p>So far, everything works OK. Let's keep the fingers' crossed ...</p>
