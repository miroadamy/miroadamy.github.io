<p>Today's Blog of the Day is "The Reader".</p>
<p>Everything about ebooks and readers - all the stuff I like. See at <a href="http://wowio.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://wowio.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>Here I discovered that Sony is <a href="http://wowio.wordpress.com/2007/09/10/new-sony-readers/" target="_blank">assumably preparing new version of reader - PRS 505</a>. From the changes that should be included, none is IMHO really so important. The memory capacity of the reader with SD cards (which are reaching 8GB  these days) is much bigger than you ever will need. If I should pick some enhancements hat would make a huge difference, it would be:</p>
<p>1)  price. Make it accessible, meaning ~ 150 USD (which is about 145 CAD :-) - just kidding)</p>
<p>2)  content - price and availability of books. The fair price for eBook should not be more than 30-40% of the paperback. Without DRM, of course. Who would want any DRM from the company with 2 rootkit fiasco's in last 2 years (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="http://thesoapvox.com/2007/08/28/sonys-new-rootkit/" target="_blank">second</a>) ?</p>
<p>3) Software - Sony please stop trying to create these terrible slow knock-off of iTunes, and outsource it to somebody that will write decent client, preferably in Java, so that it runs everywhere. Considering Sony's software history, making it opensource would help to restore the trust ...</p>
<p>Speaking of software, it should provide an easy way how to download and format RSS feed and web pages for offline reading, ideally again something in the way how iTunes handles podcasts.</p>
<p>I do not think that adding WiFi (what many people call for) will work on the eInk device - speed and lack of interactivity would allow to read only very static Web pages, and user input handling would be a big challenge.</p>
