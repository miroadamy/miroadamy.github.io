<p>Since the beginning of the biometric security project, we are using an excellent enterprise-level Wiki <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a> as knowledge repository and main team communication tool. I was not sure at the beginning, how will the Wiki approach work for all the people on the team, mostly because once before I already tried it and had not much success of introducing the idea. It was few years ago and the Wiki engine I used were nowhere in the same league as Confluence, but main problem at that time was probably the users' mindset. I am happy to report that this time it worked really really well. I am not sure whether it was because of the fantastic user friendly features and capabilities of  Confluence, or because the general awareness shifted thanks to sites like Wikipedia and people got used to the idea of user created content ... The truth is that Wiki's are mainstream now - inside or outside of the enterprise space.</p>
<p>And here yet another proof for that: <em><strong>Microsoft launched the <a href="http://msdnwiki.microsoft.com/en-us/mtpswiki/default.aspx">MSDN Wiki</a> </strong></em>that merges content provided from MSDN documentation with user added/edited content. I think it is an excellent idea - MSDN documentation certainly can be improved and enhanced in many places and letting people who actually use the product contribute to the documentation content, is the right way.</p>
<p>The MSDN Wiki engine is right now IMHO nowhere close to to Confluence level of user comfort. From what I have seen so far, Confluence is the Lexus of the Wiki world.</p>
<p>Here is the question: can largest software company in the world  deliver something at minimum comparably as good (or better) as creation of a small, opensource-based softwarehouse from Australia (which using, on top of all, Java and Tomcat as the platform) ?</p>
<p>We will see.  Maybe.  Let's hope.</p>
