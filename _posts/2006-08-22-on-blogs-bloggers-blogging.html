<p>If you would ask me to pick one technology phenomenon that had the largest   impact on and was the most characteristic for the technology during the years   1995-2000, my answer would be “Web, of course”. For the years 2000-2003 I’d   vote for eCommerce, online applications and collaboration (like Google, eBay,   Amazon and many others). And for the last 3 years, I would definitely pick   online communities and blogs.</p>
<p>Blogs are like tsunami that is changing the landscape of online content. There   is nothing really new about   <span>what</span> they are. Blog   is user editable Web page, with very few features: implicit tracking of   entries by creating calendar-based index of older entries, ability to add   comments to the entries, limited form of categorization and tagging as well as   some simple, blog-2-blog notification mechanisms (backtracks and pings). The   only aspect in which blogs are different is simplicity of creating and running   a blog. The same way as Google made searching for on-line content very easy   and accessible, blogs are the very easy way how to create that content. Good   content is one of the main reasons why people go online.</p>
<p>To have better idea about the magnitude of the effect, here are some numbers.   According to <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000436.html">David   Sifry</a></p>
<p>“… there is 50 million blogs out there (as of August 2006) and this number   doubles every 6 months.”</p>
<p>Now this is *some* growth - the blogosphere is 100 times bigger now than it   was 3 years ago.</p>
<p>“As of July 2006, about 175,000 new weblogs were created each day, which means   that on average, there are more than 2 blogs created each second of each day.   The total posting volume of the blogosphere continues to rise, showing about   1.6 Million postings per day, or about 18.6 posts per second. This is about   double the volume of about a year ago.”</p>
<p>If you would expect that huge majority of the blogs is in English, you would   be surprised. According to David, only approximately 40% blogs are in English,   trailed by about 30% in Japanese and about 15% in Chinese. I wrote “about” as   the number go up and down by few percent from month to month.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised by really high ratio of Japanese blogs - high relatively   to population size of Japan versus English speaking countries. Maybe the   penetration of the market with very advanced video-internet capable   computer-phones is responsible for the high number. I also believe   <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0374292795/sr=8-1/qid=1156212681/ref=pd_ka_1/702-7430505-7753611?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway" title="for variety of reasons">for   variety of reasons</a> that large Chinese presence in cyberspace is a good   thing, both for China as well the cyberspace. The “Internet services   superpower” - India is probably under-represented and relatively invisible,   hiding between English speaking blogs. Maybe because only few percent of huge   Indian population has Internet access.</p>
<p>These numbers are simply overwhelming. Growth rate of the blogsphere is much   higher than growth rate of the rest of WWW. Relative impact and weight of   community driven web content will soon be larger than more traditional media   with companies and organizations behind them (I consider both New York Times,   CNN.com and Yahoo! being “traditional”, because the content is created by   dedicated professionals).</p>
<p>But (there is always a “but”) - to really understand this new trend, it is   important to have deeper look on the content, authors and audience of the   blogs. A blog can be very different thing than a blog.</p>
<p>These basic questions help me to better understand and to organize my view of   the blogospere:</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>1) Who is the author ?</b></p>
<p>Is it single person providing his/her unique viewpoint or is it a community   (such as <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo</a>,   <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>) ? Is it an organization   ?<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/"><br />
</a>Most of the growth (in absolute number of blogs) is coming from new   individual bloggers, grouped around free hosting sites such as   <a href="http://www.blogger.com/home">Blogspot</a>,   <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a>,   <a "https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/"">Blogging.com</a> etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.backbonemedia.com/blogsurvey/">Corporate blogs</a> (see   <a href="http://www.backbonemedia.com/blogsurvey/blogsurvey2005.pdf">whitepaper</a>)   are also growing in popularity, both for internal and external use. Sometimes   there is dedicated group of employees commenting on and discussing internal   affairs on closed forum, sometimes the blog is public (such as   <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/e-business/ondemand/us/innovation/flash/innova.shtml" title="this one">this   one</a>   <span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/"></a>).   Corporate blogs are representing much smaller percentage of the new blogs, but   their contribution to the content is higher than from individuals. They also   more often use premium<a href="http://blogs.livingdot.com/"> hosting   sites</a>.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>2) What is the purpose / motivation for publishing ? What is the benefit   for the author ?</b><br />
Surprisingly large amount of blogs I’ve seen, did not have obvious motivation,   rather than “because I can”. The main difference between publishing a Web and   publishing a blog is very low barrier of entry. Almost everybody can blog. And   as it looks like, almost everybody does.</p>
<p>Some people start writing blogs because they are following the masses, joining   the crowds - or because their friend Mike is blogging too. Some want to   satisfy the innate human need to be heard / read, receive feedback and be more   visible, be more important or just in order to become part of some community.</p>
<p>Technology related blogs often follow “meritocracy” principle from opensource   movement. The more you contribute to a project, the higher is your influence   and “rating” among your peers. Publishing and sharing your tips, tricks and   insights on the blog is great way how to start contributing to the shared pool   of knowledge.</p>
<p>Many blogs are just plain public journals or on-line diaries. One can debate   what is the value of putting your private journal to public consumption. IMHO,   it takes some degree of exhibitionism to do that, assumed that you are honest   with yourself and writing diary, not work of fiction about a non-existing   person.</p>
<p>You have certainly seen (and likely ignored) many blogs that looked like they   were created just to let the “steam off”, to express the the author’s   frustrations. Aside from possible therapeutic effect for the owner, I find   these of little interest to spend on them any time - unless you know the   author personally. In this case, the journal blog provides unexpected insight   (often quite unwelcome). In rare cases, the effect *can* positive.</p>
<p>I have read nice dedication on one of the   <a href="http://blog.sme.sk" title="blogs">blogs</a>  (do not waste your   time going there unless you speak Slovak) where 40+ new blog writer summarized   his motives for blogging as:</p>
<p><i>” I am a father of a blogger. From his blog, I have discovered a lot about   his world and learned to understand him better. With this blog, I’d like to   return him the favor”.</i></p>
<p>Lot’s of blogs are being created daily with one very specific purpose in mind:   blogging for money. To do that, you need just two ingredients - large enough   audience visiting your site and ads they can click on. The business model is   simple: for every click on the displayed ads by your visitors, Google gets   some tiny amount of money from advertisers and sends some percentage of this   tiny amount of money to you. Which means you need many many many clicks to   earn few bucks. And only very few sites actually get enough out of it, to use   it as sustainable business model. Ads work best for focused community sites   such as Gizmodo, with huge targeted audience. One nice example of site making   money this way and still providing interesting content, created by single   individual is <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">Steve Pavlina</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are few more "business models" for monetizing your blog -   for example when a company pays seemingly unaffiliated bloggers to promote a   product or service through “objective reviews”, but I do not consider this   dubious business practices to be blogs (and certainly not worthy spending more   time on).</p>
<p>Legitimate blogs created by business tend to have better defined purpose. It   costs money to pay people to blog and as business owner, you do not do it,   unless it gives you back some value: new marketing channels, community   building, evangelization of company/products/individuals or even direct sales.   See <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/tim/">Tim O’Reilly’s blog</a> or   <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/</a>   for a great example of valuable “personal business blog”</p>
<p>Quite specific category of blogs are aspiring amateur writers and journalists,   trying to do what they cannot do as their main job: writing and publishing   fiction, novels, short stories, providing news and comments on events of   interest. For these people, the blog is just easy, zero-barrier-of-entry   delivery channel. Which leads directly to the next question: the content.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>3) What is the content/topics covered ?</b></p>
<p>Again, there is huge variety of all content imaginable out there - from blogs   about Joe through blogs about world’s politics up to blogs about galaxies. The   difference is degree of egocentrism, or in other words - how much is the   personality and life of the blogger object of the blog. Usually (unless Joe   Blogger is a celebrity) the more it is about Joe, the less interesting it is.   Why would you (as a reader) care about Joe’s private life, what he did   yesterday and what are his plans for vacation ?</p>
<p>Well, you actually *may* care if:</p>
<p>• Joe is somebody like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/">George   Clooney</a>, <a href="http://www.waynegretzky.com/">Wayne Gretzky</a>,   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> or   Add-Your-Favorite-Celebrity-Here (guess who of the three mentioned is mine   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />   )</p>
<p>• Joe happens to share something with you - it may be something good (like   your secret passion for building model airplanes in scale 1:59 which very few   people do), or something not so good (like lung cancer). By discovering a   virtual acquaintance that shares your pain or passion, you feel less alone and   may find something useful in how Joe copes with his situation.</p>
<p>• you are compulsive watcher of reality shows and spend your own life by   watching other people lives, regardless how boring they are (there must be   some amount of people like that, otherwise the reality shows could not be so   wildly popular )</p>
<p>• Joe is your neighbor across the street and you have been wondering what   business is this guy in to afford the new Lexus every year<br />
• Joe is your perspective employee or business partner, and you need to find   out more about him before you employ him / sign a deal</p>
<p>Many bloggers do not realize the hidden danger in last two cases - see   <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/24/BUGCEAT1I01.DTL">these</a>   <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/14/news/economy/blogging/">few</a>   <a href="http://news.com.com/I+was+fired+for+blogging/2010-1030_3-5490836.html">examples</a>   to be warned.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>4) What audience is the blog for? What is the benefit for the readers ?<br />
</b></p>
<p>Surprisingly many bloggers seems not to think about their audience at all,   which makes their blogs uninteresting and boring. At the other side of the   spectrum are blogs addressing by choice controversial topics, written   specifically to attract lots of readers and spark lots of heated online   discussions. You can easily tell by the titles people use for their entries.   This type of competing for the readership is very obvious when there is a   ranking system on the server which sparks the competition or when there is a   monetary incentive to have many readers - like using Google Ads. This has   sometimes the very same effect as in journalism - previously good and   respectable site degrades to some form of tabloid in chase for ad-clickers - I mean readers.</p>
<p>What value do the blog readers gets out of blog ? I do not dare to make any   guess for the others. There must be something in it for many different people,   otherwise there would be no large audiences. Basic motivation can be curiosity   and leisure - passive content consumption - pleasant way how to spend time. A   kind of new TV, with much more control over what you read/watch/listen to   (considering the increasingly popular audioblogs aka podcasts and videoblogs).</p>
<p>For me personally main value areas I get out of reading blogs and community   driven content repositories are:</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>1) learning and problem solving<br />
</b></p>
<p>You may not always find answer you are looking for in the “traditional”   professional Website. Whether I need need an explanation why am I getting   mysterious SQL Server 2005 error message or how to get iMovie to recognize   MPEG file from Sony HDD digital camera, my best bet usually are forums, Wiki’s   and blogs. None of them is clearly superior, and blogs have their perfect   place in the infospace.</p>
<p>Compared to Wikis and Forums, Blogs are more personal,with more narrow focus.   Which means once you find a blogger that works on similar problem or in the   same area, you have best possible match. In Forums, many people contribute and   create topics. This leads to wider area coverage and to more ideas, but also   to less coherence and (in order to find something) more clutter for the reader   to work through. Blogs are less formal and less structured than Wiki’s. It   leads people to providing and sharing content more easily. I have less worries   and things to consider when I add new entry on my blog than when I am editing   a Wiki page, possibly modifying somebody else’s contribution. There is more   personal touch in blog and little need for consensus as with Wiki. Blogs are   also more convenient for the authors - content for the blog can be created   offline and uploaded, edited directly in browser or even sent through email,   whereas Wiki and Forum must be accessed only through browser.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>2) navigation guide and discovery<br />
</b></p>
<p>It happened many times with books: I have found blog about books, where the   blog author highly rated several books that I liked a lot as well. On the same   site, I have also found recommended other books, I never heard about before.   After reading them, I loved them. This is how I found   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a> series, the   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>’s   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345346904/104-4361993-9959958?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Heechee</a>   saga as well as   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski">Andrzej Sapkowski   </a>fantasy masterwork . Similar idea are Amazon “recommends” and Amazon user   book lists, but there is bigger chance of commercial motivation behind book   great 5-star review and also less visibility to the personality behind the   recommendation(s).</p>
<p><b><br />
3) filter …<br />
</b></p>
<p>something like SQL View, limiting the data to what is relevant. It is one of   the ways how to deal with information overload. Many people browse the Web and   blog on nuggets they discover. If you find and pick right person, his/her   trail may be very interesting to follow.</p>
<p>The bookmark community sites such as   <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>,   <a href="http://digg.com/">digg.com</a>,   <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit.com</a> are doing something very similar,   but filtering “by statistics” rather by interest. They are usually best bet to   discover trends, fashion waves and new fads, but if your information taste   differs a lot from Average User, you may be better off with finding few   virtual buddies that are more like you and follow their trails - through their   blogs or bookmark collections. Chances are, they are reading digg or reddit   and will report their findings anyway.</p>
<p><b><br />
Blogs++<br />
</b></p>
<p>With all the millions blogs in existence, what is the point of adding another   drop to the sea of blogs ? What is the motivation and intention of the author   of this one ? Where in the classification should this blog fit in ?</p>
<p>This is an individual blog. It does not represent standpoint of the   <a href="http://www.thinknostic.com/">company I am affiliated with</a>. There   certainly is strong alignment between many of my company values, views and   visions and my values, goals and visions - which is why I work there - but   this is not meant to be our official PR.</p>
<p>The topics reflect my interests and are therefore (mostly) technology and   cyberspace related. From “real life” I am commenting on very few topics, e.g.   books and personal productivity / personal development (aka “lifehacks”), all   of which are quite close to technology and cyberspace. I have all intentions   to avoid easily inflammable topics (such as politics or religion) unless it is   “flamewar” about technology (for example Linux vs. Windows vs. Mac or .NET   contra Java - be my guests!).</p>
<p>It is not a personal journal. It is subjective - as every blog is - but I’ll   try my best to stay focused on the topics other than my personal life. No   pictures of the kids or family vacations here. They are some out here on the   Web, but audience is limited to mostly family only. Unless you know me quite   well, it would not really interest you anyway.</p>
<p>Writing a blog takes a lot of time. This blog is my spare time activity. While   ago, I found out that for me personally   <span>writing</span> is the best way how to   organize my thoughts, pretty much on anything. During last two-three years,   more and more of this writing was happening on computer. So in addition of   many paper notebooks, I have created many small files, in variety of formats,   spread across variety of computers. As many users of multiple computers, only   way how to have my stuff available was to store it somewhere on-line. I tried   several offline+synchronization strategies too, with mixed results, but that   is a different topic, I’ll get back to it.<br />
So my files as well as electronic trace of interesting topics and places have   been stored online for over two years now.</p>
<p>What benefit do I expect to get out  of making my e-Stuff publicly   accessible ?</p>
<p>Several benefits, in fact:</p>
<p><b>- quality of content.</b> I saw huge jump in quality when I started to   write things down compared to just thinking about them. Writing forced me to   formulate my thoughts much more precisely and writing/typing slowed me down   enough to spot obvious problems. I hope for similar effect when going from   writing privately to writing publicly. Chance of a feedback and possibility of   an audience will (hopefully) force me to improve my communication skills,   upgrade my English grammar and vocabulary and communicate more clearly. Time   will show if it will indeed happen …</p>
<p><b>- accessibility</b>. If something is easily accessible for everybody, it is   easily accessible for myself as well   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/icon_smile.gif" alt="-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><b>- diligence in active processing of the content</b>. Responsibility of   public blog will hopefully help to overcome laziness. It happens all the time:   I have interesting idea or observation, but because I am lazy, I just fire off   an email to myself with 3 cryptic words or write them down on piece of paper.   Week later, nothing makes sense any more, and idea is gone. If I’d spend 5   more minutes on making it a short blog entry, it could have been still there.   With my Mac virtually always with me, I can do that from any place</p>
<p><b>- learning on own mistakes</b><br />
You can never learn from a mistake unless you find out you’ve made one first.   And nobody will give any feedback, unless they know what you are doing …</p>
<p><b>-   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity" title="synchronicity">synchronicity</a>   and   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity">serendipity</a></b>.<br />
One cannot rely on it, but I have seen evidence of it too many times to ignore   it. Just trying to increasing the chances of any of that happening again, is   worth the effort.</p>
<p>Scrolling back to top in   <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" title="ecto">ecto</a> , I think that the   very first skill I have to master will be how to write shorter entries :-).</p>
<p>If you managed to read until here, thanks for your time. See you soon.</p>
