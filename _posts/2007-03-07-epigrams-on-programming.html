<p>My favorite top ten epigrams, for more see <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html" class="linkification-ext" title="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html">http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html</a></p>
<p>0. One man's constant is another man's variable</p>
<p>1. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.</p>
<p>2. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.</p>
<p>3. A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.</p>
<p>4. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.</p>
<p>5. You can't communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</p>
<p>6. Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.</p>
<p>7. In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 5 year period will be.</p>
<p>8. In computing, the mean time to failure keeps getting shorter.</p>
<p>9. In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general -- and often we know it too quickly.</p>
<p>A. It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.</p>
<p>B. Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub- systems and so on ad infinitum - which is why we’re always starting over.</p>
<p>C. Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught not to. So it is with great programmers.</p>
<p>D. To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.</p>
<p>E. Perhaps if we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we’d be able to read them.</p>
<p>F. One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.</p>
