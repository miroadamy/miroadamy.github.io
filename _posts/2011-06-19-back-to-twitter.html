<p>After being away for over 4 months, I am back on Twitter. No, I did not miss the stream of 160 character mixture of news, trivia, white noise and occasional nuggets. Three main reasons:</p>
<p>1) Twitter seems to to become  unavoidable - more and more services assume that one has twitter account. Many cyberevents rules start with "retweet this" or "tweet that" which of course one cannot do without Twitter account</p>
<p>2) Direct messaging via Twitter is one very convenient method how to add information to many service: new todo in Toodledo, Evernote and so on. It is MUCH faster than starting any client on an iPhone.</p>
<p>3) Twitter is after all the best medium for sharing links. Facebook does not cut it  if you want to keep friend count reasonable so there is a gap between Facebook and LinkedIn</p>
<p>Alas, I am back, with my old handle 'miroadamy'.</p>
<p>Hello - Nael and the gang ...</p>
