<p>Joel Oleson is suffering if you do not blog ! Sounds strange ? Read the article <strong><em>Join the SharePoint Blogging Revolution!</em></strong><br />
at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joelo/archive/2007/05/25/you-don-t-blog-i-m-suffering-because-you-don-t-blog.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/joelo/archive/2007/05/25/you-don-t-blog-i-m-suffering-because-you-don-t-blog.aspx</a></p>
<p>He makes several very good points - which have very little to do with Sharepoint - but I think the best one is helping the "organic indexing" of the Web space and helping the search engines out there better rank content. I wrote about this <a href="http://thinkwrap.wordpress.com/2007/01/11/repetition-is-the-mother-of-the-web/" target="_blank">while ago</a>.</p>
