<p>I've stumbled upon <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html">this page</a>, full of math jokes. Many of them are IMHO really good and extremly funny (your mileage may vary, though).</p>
<p>My favorite few:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two male mathematicians are in a bar. The first one says to the second that the average person knows very little about basic mathematics. The second one disagrees, and claims that most people can cope with a reasonable amount of math.</p>
<p>The first mathematician goes off to the washroom, and in his absence the second calls over the waitress. He tells her that in a few minutes, after his friend has returned, he will call her over and ask her a question. All she has to do is answer one third x cubed.</p>
<p>She repeats "one thir -- dex cue"?<br />
He repeats "one third x cubed".<br />
Her: `one thir dex cuebd'? Yes, that's right, he says. So she agrees, and goes off mumbling to herself, "one thir dex cuebd...".</p>
<p>The first guy returns and the second proposes a bet to prove his point, that most people do know something about basic math. He says he will ask the blonde waitress an integral, and the first laughingly agrees. The second man calls over the waitress and asks "what is the integral of x squared?".<br />
The waitress says "one third x cubed" and while walking away, turns back and says over her shoulder "plus a constant!"</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>  A mathematician organizes a lottery in which the prize is an infinite amount of  money. When the winning ticket is drawn, and the jubilant winner comes to claim his  prize, the mathematician explains the mode of payment: "1 dollar now, 1/2 dollar next  week, 1/3 dollar the week after that..."</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous mathematician was to give a keynote speech at a conference. Asked for an advance summary, he said he would present a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem -- but they should keep it under their hats. When he arrived, though, he spoke on a much more prosaic topic. Afterwards the conference organizers asked why he said he'd talk about the theorem and then didn't. He replied this was his standard practice, just in case he was killed on the way to the conference.</p></blockquote>
<p>the last one - in memory of John von Neumann:</p>
<blockquote><p> The following problem can be solved either the easy way or the hard way.</p>
<p>Two trains 200 miles apart are moving toward each other; each one is going at a speed of 50 miles per hour. A fly starting on the front of one of them flies back and forth between them at a rate of 75 miles per hour. It does this until the trains collide and crush the fly to death. What is the total distance the fly has flown?</p>
<p>The fly actually hits each train an infinite number of times before it gets crushed, and one could solve the problem the hard way with pencil and paper by summing an infinite series of distances. The easy way is as follows: Since the trains are 200 miles apart and each train is going 50 miles an hour, it takes 2 hours for the trains to collide. Therefore the fly was flying for two hours. Since the fly was flying at a rate of 75 miles per hour, the fly must have flown 150 miles. That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>When this problem was posed to John von Neumann, he immediately replied, "150 miles."<br />
"It is very strange," said the poser, "but nearly everyone tries to sum the infinite series."<br />
"What do you mean, strange?" asked Von Neumann. "That's how I did it!"</p></blockquote>
