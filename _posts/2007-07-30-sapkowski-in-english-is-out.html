<p>For all my fantasy-loving friends who consider reading in Czech or Polish too inconvenient: the first book of the grand master Andrzej Sapkowski in English is out. It is book of short stories about Geralt, the Hexer (or Witcher if you want), who is the main character of the 5-book saga with the same name.</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/o/ASIN/0575077824/026-2894389-4330029?SubscriptionId=0YFVC5M08H6XK4274Z02" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>
