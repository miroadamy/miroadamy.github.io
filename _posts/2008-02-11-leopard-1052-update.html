<p>Apple released today the 10.5.2 update. After over a year and half with Mac platform (and over 2 months on Mac only work environment) I become fearless and installed update without too much worries :-). Year ago, I guess I would be quite concerned whether the Service Pack will or will not render my work notebook useless with unreparable registry ... I still remember the fun after SP2 got installed ...</p>
<p>But back to the topic. Upgrade went smooth and after 2 bangs (reboots) everything seems to work OK. Finally there is an option to "tigerize" the translucent menu, without add-ons and hacks. Time machine has small menu item to access preferences. The update promises WiFi improvements (tests pending). What seems not get fixed is the annoying rfc1323 TCP/IP stack setting (see <a href="http://thinkwrap.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/fix-for-the-stalled-downloads-in-leopard/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>So far the only things broken is the Beta version of fantastic little utility <a href="http://haroldchu.id.au/index.php?q=node/2" target="_blank">Library books</a> (highly recommended - it does support many libraries, including <a href="http://www.biblioottawalibrary.ca/index_e.html" target="_blank">our</a>). The error message that comes after the program start says:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language='java']</p>
<p>NSInvalidArgumentException</p>
<p>*** -[DebugController length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x2ade20</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]<br />
What helps is to roll back to version 2.5 which works just fine.</p>
