# Git committer activity

Git command git shortlog is very handy to see what is team activity.

### Show committer activity - whole project

```
git shortlog -sn | head -20

  1615	Jochen Theodorou
  1031	James Strachan
   749	Guillaume Laforge

```

### Full history with commits

```
git shortlog
Adrian Nistor (6):
      avoiding wasted work according to GROOVY-5823 to GROOVY-5831, except GROOVY-5828 Signed-off-by: Jochen Theodorou <blackdrag@gmx.org>
      Fast exit from method ClassCompletionVerifier.checkMethodForWeakerAccessPrivileges
      Fast exit from loop in StaticTypeCheckingVisitor.inferReturnTypeGenerics
      Avoiding unnecessary string comparisons in loop
      GROOVY-5854: Fast loop exit in ClassNode constructor
      Inefficient method DefaultGrailsDomainClassInjector.implementsMethod

Alan Green (20):
      Fix bug: was ignoring first char of octal escapes.
      Added asBool conversion for Strings: convert empty strings to false, and non-empty strings to true.
      Made AsmClassGenerator understand String asBool the same that Invoker has.
      Backed out fix to GROOVY-812 as it was causing test cases to fail. Will also post a note to groovy-dev.
      Fix build - UberTestCase could not find SpreadMapOperatorTest
      Changed to use jmock-1.0.1 instead of jmock-SNAPSHOT
      Fix for GROOVY-1081
      Added Collection.sum() and Collection.sum(Closure) methods and test cases.
      Make it possible to set variables in the console shell bindings before     the console is openned.
      Fix bug: could not add components to root pane with constraints. Now you can.
      Added history feature.
      Fixed problem when running from groovyConsole.bat
      Added special handling for showing collections and maps
      Fix problem with using BoxLayout on top level container (Frame, Dialog, Applet)
      Added new features to Console     - intercepts std output     - binds last result to '_' and history of results to '__'
      Fix error with bindings when creating a new window
      Changed is() to use == instead of System.identityHashCode()
      Console was reporting null result when result was [], "" or 0
      Fix so that AssertionErrors are handled properly.
      Fixed SourceUnit.failedWithUnexpectedEOF() to correctly recognise incomplete source, allowing the InteractiveShell to be a bit more useful - GROOVY-472 and GROOVY-1021     Removed UnexpectedTokenException class as it does not appear to be used any longer.

Alan Thompson (1):
      Fix a bug in JsonBuilder.toPrettyString() for zero-length strings.
```

More interesting is when we restrict by branch


```
git shortlog -sn origin/GROOVY_1_5_X
   137  Paul King
    92  Jochen Theodorou
    25  Roshan Dawrani
    25  Jim White
    23  Guillaume Laforge
    14  Martin Kempf
     9  Danno Ferrin
     7  Alex Tkachman
     5  Andres Almiray
     4  Peter Niederwieser
     2  Jeremy Rayner
     2  Russel Winder
     1  Jeff Brown
     1  Thom Nichols
```      

And of course, it can be combined with other selection operators:

```
git shortlog  --author="graeme" --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]"
