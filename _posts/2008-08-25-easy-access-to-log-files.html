<p>Here is the scoop: I need to provide access to multiple log files spread across multiple directories of multiple machines. For example - the JBoss log files and nohup.out, ATG log files, and so on - so that the testers can see what happened on server side when something looks fishy on front end.</p>
<p>One option would be to write a document that contails IP's of the machines, create user accounts, make sure that they have just enough access rights to see the files but not disturb anything else ...</p>
<p>Other option is to leverage the already installed Python across all the servers. I wish it was Ruby, but one cannot have everything.</p>
<p>On each machine, I created directory - e.g. ~/webaccess and made symbolic links to all log files or log directories required. Then I placed this python script into the directory:</p>
<pre>[code language='python']

#!/usr/bin/python

import SimpleHTTPServer
import SocketServer

# minimal web server.  serves files relative to the
# current directory.

PORT = 9999

Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

Handler.extensions_map.update({
'': 'application/octet-stream', # Default
'.out': 'text/plain',
'.log': 'text/plain'
})
httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

print "serving at port", PORT
httpd.serve_forever()

[/code]</pre>
<p>and started it as</p>
<p>nohup ./simpleserver.py &amp;</p>
<p>From this moment on, all files linked (actually all files in subtree of server directory) are accessible by going to http://SERVERNAME:9999/ - which shows directory listing for linked files.</p>
<p>On one of the machine, I have placed additional file - index.html that contained links to all other server names.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://effbot.org/librarybook/simplehttpserver.htm" target="_blank">this page</a> for inspiration.</p>
