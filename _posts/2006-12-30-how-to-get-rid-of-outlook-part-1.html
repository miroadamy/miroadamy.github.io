<p>I have decided to stop using Microsoft Outlook. No, I did not have any major issues with it, no horror stories of crashed, unreadable emails or viruses. As long as you use decent anti-virus (for example <a href="http://www.nod32.com/">this one</a>), switch off automatic loading of images and never do anything stupid such as clicking on an attachment or a link in email, you are reasonably safe. What got me to switch was lack of interoperability between anything non-Windows and Outlook and headaches of synchronization with on-line information. Using Outlook-only everywhere is not an option for me, because I need to use Mac as well as Windows and buying license of Outlook for every notebook, PC and virtual machine would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Decision is easy step, what is harder is to implement it. Outlook is (was for me) 4 different things</p>
<p>- email client<br />
- contact manager<br />
- to-do list manager<br />
- calendar</p>
<p>I am lucky enough not be dependant on Exchange integration or on corporate shared calendaring solution, which is often one of the main reasons people are stuck with Outlook. Until recently, I also needed Outlook to keep my PocketPC synchronized with rest of the world. During few last month, I use my Toshiba e830 more and more are eReader device and less for actual information process, so this became less critical. Final blow came from unexpected angle - when I discovered the  <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_windowsmobile.php">The Missing Sync</a>. I can synchronize PocketPC on Mac, without needing the Outlook or even the Windows.</p>
<p>To completely avoid Outlook, I need to find reasonably good replacement for each of these 4 areas, so that the result is better, more open, location-agnostic and multi-platform. The result will probably less integrated than Outlook, but that's reality of Web 2.0 versus desktop applications.</p>
<p>- For email, I have good solution in combination of GMail/Thunderbird (see yesterday entry).</p>
<p>- For calendar, I am evaluating Google Calendar.</p>
<p>- For ToDo's, my current favorite is <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>.</p>
<p>- Right now, toughest part are contacts. Still working on this one.</p>
<p>I will cover these in the coming days. Stay tuned.</p>
