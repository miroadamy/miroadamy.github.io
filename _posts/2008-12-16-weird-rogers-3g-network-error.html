<p>Since about Sunday, Dec 7th (I remember exactly because I noticed it when leaving the regular ByMUG meeting at Patty Bolands) my iPhone for no particular reason decided to translocate itself to GMT+1 time zone. It was not visible immediately, only emails received at 16:20 were shown as received 6 hour in the future.</p>
<p>All this without any changes or installing anything on my end ...</p>
<p>The Clock application showed what was wrong (this snapshot was taken on Sunday, 16:02 Ottawa time):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-620" title="img_0007" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_0007.png" alt="img_0007" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>I tried to change settings for Date and Time to manual and correct the problem, but any time I switched back to keeping time synchronized automatically it jumped back to wrong time.</p>
<p>I believe this is a Rogers problem as it happens only when 3G is on. With Edge, you can safely switch forth and back beween any impact on the correct time. It would look like the iPhone is getting wrong information from the 3G network about time or about timezone (despite the settings of timezone to Ottawa, Canada). I tried Toronto and Montreal for timezone settings - same results.</p>
<p>Currently there are two workarounds:</p>
<p>1) Use Edge and suffer the slow speed, partially compensated by better battery life<br />
2) Use manual setting and take into account that without network synchronization time your phone can get out of sync byt as much as few minutes<br />
per day.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8591231#8591231" target="_blank">discussion thread</a> on Apple site.</p>
<p>I suggest that everybody that experiences this calls Rogers and requests fix. I would also consider asking for refund of part of the data plan, because this problem basically does not allow to use the 3G service we are paying for.</p>
<p>Chances are slim for getting few bucks back but maybe it will help to elevate the severity of the problem in their Bugzilla (or whatever they use for issue tracking).</p>
