<p>Thanks to Kovid Goyal, the Sony Reader's very own terrible software (iTunes wannabe) can very soon be decommissioned from  my software collection. The <a href="https://libprs500.kovidgoyal.net/" target="_blank">libprs500 project</a>, multi-platform solution written in Python works very well and allows to move data between Sony and your Mac / Linux / Windows. The UI is actually pretty decent, considering that it is not native Cocoa app:</p>

<p>You can also edit metadata, which is very important because of the limited screen space on PRS500. As added benefit, the application gives you a reader for LRF file format that allows reading unprotected LRF books on the Mac/Linux as well in addition to Windows. Here is a snapshot:</p>

<p>And best for the end: the libprs500 can do format conversion from TXT, HTML, RTF and LIT (haleluja !) as well as PDF - as long as it does not contain too many images. Seems like Christmas arrived twice this winter - and we have still Macworld ahead :-)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://www.kovidgoyal.net/" target="_blank">Kovid</a> who wrote this thing and to Peter who made aware of it ...</p>
