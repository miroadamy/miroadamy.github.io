<p>Does it work ?</p>
<p>We'll see - blogging from the train</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkwrap.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/p-640-480-4ffe4684-b7f1-4ee2-8a32-e7b942033677.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-364" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/p-640-480-4ffe4684-b7f1-4ee2-8a32-e7b942033677.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>All the above - including the picture was created and posted on iPhone, using the Wordpress Application (thanks to Peter K. to make me aware of it). I have not used it much, but the first impressions are certainly positive: it works and allows to compose reasonable blog entry, including images on the go. As long as you are fast typist on the miniature keyboard - which I am not, so I will still prefer for longer text the great comfort of Macbook Pro keyboard (probably the best keyboard I have ever used so far). But it can be handy for short posts so I am going to keep it. Price - zero Alexes ((C) Macbreak weekly) == $0. Free. Not Libre, not opensource - thanks anyway ...</p>
<p>If you want just to post images and have SmugMug account, there is another free app that I have been using quite a lot. Mostly because there is no way how I can use my 6GB allocated data transfer montly limit ;-)</p>
<p>The application is named SmugShot and allows to take picture and upload it to dedicated gallery on SmugMug. I have been taking lots of pictures and posting them into <a href="http://adamy.smugmug.com/gallery/5597874_EUK9h#P-1-18">my Smugshot Gallery</a> - which is (unlike most of other pictures) publicly viewable. See for yourself - the images are nothing breathtaking, but if you have not seen SmugMug, look at it - IMHO it is very worth of the price.</p>
