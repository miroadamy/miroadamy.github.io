<p>Last year, when I got my first Mac, it was a wild ride of discoveries and trying out new software. As result I have ended up with many programs installed that I do not really need or use. Fortunately, the uninstall process is as simple as install and there is no registry that could get corrupted, so it was not really a big deal. With the new one, I am going to be much more selective what I put on the harddrive and what not.</p>
<p>I've decided to keep track what I installed to make the reinstallation (should it be ever required) easier. Here is what I have installed so far:</p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/" target="_blank"><strong> iWork 08</strong></a> - very nice replacement for Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><strong>TextMate</strong> – "THE editor" - <a href="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</a>. Most amazing editor I have ever encountered, since Emacs. Similarly powerful (I have not really mastered it completely and mostly forgot the Emacs commands to make fair comparison) - but with UI that is nice and elegant (unlike Emacs which is super powerful but ugly like hell)</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></strong> - Java IDE most of our clients use<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><strong><a href="http://ruby.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans Ruby </a></strong><span class="caps"><strong><a href="http://ruby.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">IDE</a></strong> - the other IDE, currently the best IDE for Ruby development<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" target="_blank">Adium</a> - chat client that can talk to MSN Messenger, Yahoo messenger and GoogleTalk. No voice, yet - this is what Skype and iChat's are for. </span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver?DokuWiki=02a7952f4c2d0735422bebf3b077f8b8" target="_blank">QuickSilver</a> - the launcher and much more. It is actually easier to use it than to explain it :-) </span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><span class="caps"><a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/23594" target="_blank">CHMOX</a> </span>- reader for Microsoft compiled Help file format (.CHM).<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/23594"><br />
</a></span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/maindownload.php" target="_blank">NeoOffice</a> - I should not really need it with iWork, but until I test that the exported documents cause no troubles for the other on MS-Office, this is my "plan B"</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://cord.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Cord</a> - open source Windows Remote Desktop client</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/home_learning/librarybooks.html">Library Books</a> - nice menulet that alerts you when books are due for return to local library. Ottawa public library is supported. </span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://www.keepassx.org/" target="_blank">KeePassX</a> - secure vault that stores your serial numbers, logins, passwords in very secure way. Open source, multi platform (OS-X, Linux, Windows) and the data files are fully compatible. </span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">iTerm</a> - another terminal. May not be necessary, as the default Terminal looks pretty good in Leopard - but it is great to have an opensource alternative, should that not be the case :-)</span><br />
<span class="hover_target"></span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(BitTorrent_client)" target="_blank">Transmission</a> - bittorrent client<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="hover_target"> <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">JungleDisk</a> - the Amazon S3 Service client. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/pro/" target="_blank">OmniOutliner Pro</a> - the outliner. See the manual for details.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" target="_blank">VMWare Fusion</a> - virtualization environment</p>
<p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank">VLC</a> - media player</p>
<p>I have also installed whole bunch of Java libraries and tools (such as Ant, Spring framework, Tomcat, Glassfish, Jakarta Commons) and Ruby gems - but that's too much detail for the moment :-).</p>
