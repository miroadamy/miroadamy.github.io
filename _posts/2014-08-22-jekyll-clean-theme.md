As part of "back to basics" software minimalism movement, I have exported the old Wordpress blog
and loaded it into Jekyll with intention to publish it on my Github 

This contains almost 10 years worth of history of my posts, plus few not yet previously unpublished posts.

It is based on Jekyll Clean theme, 
created by Scott Emmons - see it / get it from [github](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean).


If you are interested in the Jekyll Clean theme:

* See the [live demo](https://scotte.github.io/jekyll-clean).
* See it [in action on Scott's blog](https://scotte.org).

Migration process
=================

I exported the Wordpress using Admin export tool - which produced the huge XML file.

I forked the jekyll-clean and made sure it works

```
$ git clone git@github.com:miroadamy/jekyll-now.git
$ cd jekyll-now
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll serve
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:scotte/jekyll-clean.git
```

The last one is to allow getting fixes from Scott.

Then I installed importer and few required gems to run the import

```
$ sudo gem install jekyll-paginate
$ sudo gem install github-pages
$ sudo gem install jekyll-import
$ sudo gem install hpricot
$ sudo gem install open_uri_redirections
$ mv ~/Downloads/miro039sworld.wordpress.2016-03-14.xml ..

$ ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import"; JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({ "source" => "/Users/miro/src/PLG/miro039sworld.wordpress.2016-03-14.xml" })'

$ git checkout -b master
$ git push origin master
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Imported the old Wordpress blog from miroadamy.com"
```

Now browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000
