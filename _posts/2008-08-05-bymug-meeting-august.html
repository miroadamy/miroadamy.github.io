<p>This Sunday, as every first Sunday in month we had regular <a href="http://www.bymug.ca/" target="_blank">Bytown Mac User</a> Group meeting at usual place - Patty Bolands Pub at the <a href="http://www.byward-market.com/" target="_blank">Market</a>. It was great meeting because we had many newcomers - both to the group as well as to the platform, including very fresh Mac switch - a happy owner of 24 hours old Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>The presentations were very suited for the audience of newcomers, especially Katheryne's demo on customizing the Mac. She was kind enough to send the links to the talk (the mailing list). I think that the links are very useful for wider audience than just the ByMUG folks, so I will repost them here ... withour her permission, but in here very own words :-)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your attention during my presentation - these are the times I am very happy I chose the MBP over the MacBook :) Here are the links as promised:</p>
