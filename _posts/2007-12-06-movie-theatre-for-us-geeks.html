<p>Did you know that for the price of two movie tickets you can spend the full month watching interesting stuff that matters ? This is true, as long as</p>
<p>a) your definition of  of  "interesting stuff that matters" is a bit on the nerd site of a spectrum</p>
<p>b) you do not get full package with your movie ticket - I mean popcorn + soda - just the ticket.</p>
<p>If you do go for popcorn, we should say "for the price of 1.2 movie ticket", because the amount we talk here about is  $25 USD, which still is almost the same amount in loonies. As for the case a), do you find that an example of <em>interesting stuff that matters</em> is video tutorials about development in Ruby on Rails (22 hours), advanced techniques in Photoshop or even Silverlight essentials ? If yes, look at the <a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda movie library</a>. It is subscription based service that offers over 2'000 tutorials on wide variety of all things digital, covering both deeper, developer level areas as well as more general user topics.</p>
<p>The videos must be watched on-line (no downloads are available, just the stream), but the streaming is very smooth and image quality is very acceptable. Most of the tutorials are screencasts with voice-over, some are combination of slides and demos. The lessons are cut into reasonably short (3-15 minutes) pieces, which fits well into busy schedule. To have an idea about the quality of the stuff, many tutorials have few free few chapters - check them out.</p>
<p>If you prefer to pay as you go and want deeper, very ruby-esque and rails-ish topic, look at the <a href="http://peepcode.com/" target="_blank">Peepcode</a>. I do not like the name - but the content is good, screencasts done by the guys who know what they are talking about. The single "show" (about an hour long, give or take) costs $9 for single download, or in packs of 5 ($40) and 10 ($70). Unlike the Lynda, these screencasts can be downloaded and as nice surprise, the downloads are reqular Quicktime movies, without the DRM nonsense. Recomended.</p>
<p>And speaking of <strong>evil things</strong> like DRM, <strong>you may not be aware that something unpleasant is possibly going to happen</strong> in that great country of ours: <strong>Canadian version of DMCA</strong>. Look at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/27/canadas-coming-dmca.html" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2419/125/" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/12/02/howto-fight-canadas.html" target="_blank">this</a> and if you care, <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1447/273/" target="_blank">join the crowds</a> - or at least, help spread the word.</p>
