<p>Just stumbled upon <a href="http://macgiver.wordpress.com/">this blog</a> and noted at least three things of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>he has got a new a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macpro/">Mac Pro</a> (I am green with envy :-) )</li>
<li>uses as a nick nice wordplay on MacGyver (this name has special meaning for all us, ex-<a href="http://www.branhamgroup.com/branham300/details.php?year=2001&amp;company_ID=280">Montage</a> folks)</li>
<li>he started to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective C</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a> and blogs about it, I am curious  - (not that I plan to give up Java, C# and Python  ..)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see his <a href="http://macgiver.wordpress.com/2006/08/20/freeware-and-shareware-for-the-mac-2/">list of recommended (mostly) free Mac applications</a>. Going to try out some of them for sure !</p>
