<p>Microsoft Press is handing out 3 books:</p>
<p>- Introducing Microsoft LINQ by Paolo Pialorsi and Marco Russo</p>
<p>- Introducing ASP.NET Ajax by Dino Esposito</p>
<p>- Introducing Microsoft Silverlight 1.0 by Laurence Moroney</p>
<p>Silverlinght 1.0 is probably a bit outdated (with 1.1/2.0 close), but the others should be good, judging by the authors. Dino Esposito wrote couple of very good books on ASP.NET and .NET.</p>
