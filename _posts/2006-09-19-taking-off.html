<p>In few hours I am taking off for a quick trip overseas, which very likely means that I will be quiet - at least as far as blogging goes. Not that the place I am heading to is not wired enough - actually, the <a href="http://www.chello.com/">broadband</a> penetration is surprisingly high. The real reason is that I will be moving around a lot and meeting lot of people, so the blog must wait (yes, I am taking the Mac with me - what have you expected ...).</p>
<p>On the topic of flying: this is hilarious account of what would a fly attendant say if they would drink <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum">Veritaserum</a> before the safety instruction speech :-). Quick quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"<font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Your life-jacket can be found under your seat, but please do not remove it now. In fact, do not bother to look for it at all. In the event of a landing on water, an unprecedented miracle will have occurred, because in the history of aviation the number of wide-bodied aircraft that have made successful landings on water is zero. This aircraft is equipped with inflatable slides that detach to form life rafts, not that it makes any difference. Please remove high-heeled shoes before using the slides. We might as well add that space helmets and anti-gravity belts should also be removed, since even to mention the use of the slides as rafts is to enter the realm of science fiction."</font></em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can enjoy the rest <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=7884654">here</a></p>
<p>See you in two weeks, assumed that Lufthansa makes it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava">Bratislava</a> in one piece. If not - Yan knows all the admin passwords for the servers as well :-).</p>
