      <p>It is this time of year - Christmas parties. It looks like the number of parties we go to every year increases - did not figure out yet which function it is, let's hope it is not exponential. This year, the number was four. First was traditional Christmas party at Peter's place. Second one - which I unfortunately missed - was a gettogether of Montage/Allstream alumni. I was sick and in bed - sorry I missed this one. Hope that there will be more opportunities for meeting during the long winter that is still ahead of us. Third party - "the party" - is Thinknostic Christmas Party, this year happening at Steve's place. And the party marathon will be closed by tomorrow's Tirestamp party at Sean's.</p>
<p>Looking back on Thinknostic party, the growth is soo large. When we started in 2004, in was more like very private dinner of the founders and spouses. Party but not real party. The next year, the attendance was much bigger - somewhere around 20 people. Today, I expect more than double that count. If everybody who works with us would attend, we would be getting to closer to like 60. This is some number !</p>
<p>Not only our party has this large positive gradient. During last 2 years, Tirestamp parties had been showing similar symptoms: from the small group of engineers, developers plus Scott, the company has grown and matured significantly. Should all the people attend (inclusive the US operations), I guess Sean would need bigger house (not that his current residence any small, quite the opposite).</p>
<p>And because saying Merry Christmas in not politically correct, here is something more acceptable (do not know the source, friend emailed it to me few years ago):</p>
<blockquote><p>Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low-stress, non-addictive, gender-neutral celebration of the winter solstice holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with respect for the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions of others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all.</p>
<p>And a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2005, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make this country great (not to imply that North America is necessarily greater than any other region or is the only "America" in the Western hemisphere), and without regard to the race, creed, colour, age, physical ability, religious faith, gender or sexual orientation of the wishee.</p>
<p>This wish is limited to the customary and usual good tidings for a period of one year, or until the issuance of a subsequent holiday greeting, whichever comes first. "Holiday" is not intended to, nor shall it be considered, limited to the usual Judeo-Christian celebrations or observances, or to such activities of any organized or ad hoc religious community, group, individual, or belief (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>Note: By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms. This greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal and is revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. This greeting is freely transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. This greeting implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for the wishee her/himself or others, or responsibility for the consequences which may arise from the implementation or non-implementation of same.</p>
<p>This greeting is void where prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Have a great HOLIDAY and an awesome NEW YEAR!</p></blockquote>
