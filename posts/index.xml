      <description>My work in last few years took my away from practical coding towards DevOps. Despite the increased role of IaaC in our DevOps, this often means living in iTerm and AWS console with interaction not being captured in any form.
On writing side, lots of my output shifted from code towards writing text in Wiki&amp;rsquo;s, GoogleDocs and more and more in Slack messages. The code I write are short one-liners or small scripts with very short life span.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s blog of the day is a special one. It does not deal with cloud, DevOps or distributed systems. The theme of the blog is travel, life of digital nomad and observations on life from a perspective of a smart young woman, working as Online English teacher and travelling a lot while doing so - https://bookandtravel.blog/
What makes this blog dear and interesting to me is that it&amp;rsquo;s author is my daughter Silvia.</description>

      <description>Parallel building challenges Unlike Github, Gitlab considers Hugo blogs first class citizens and does not impose any restrictions on repo naming.
I had 3 challenges to overcome related to co-existence of GH and GL versions:
 I need to use same repo for both GH and GL the submodule link for public does not work on GL the site root is different - I have no custom domain forward for GitLab  Using same repo To separate the GH and GL, I have added 2 remotes to repo and special branch gitlab-pages.</description>

      <description>How does the blog setup and publishing work Before I forget, here is how the current configuration works.
There are two repositories at play:
 source repo - https://github.com/miroadamy/miroadamy.com github pages repo (== GHPR) - https://github.com/miroadamy/miroadamy.github.io  The blog source repo contains only source files (.md, static media etc). This repo has usual submodules under the /themes - e.g. /themes/even which is one currently used.
The Githup pages repo contains generated static site, with index.</description>

      <description>I have just returned from DockerCon Europe 2018 and I’d like to share my impressions while they are fresh in my mind. It was my first DockerCon so I was not quite sure what to expect. As the title says, it was great experience and barring the scaling issue (more below) could have been really awesome experience.
But let&amp;rsquo;s take things in order. First location - Barcelona. Hard to pick better place in December than Spain.</description>

      <description>I have found local clone of this repo while cleaning up the disk. The source was originally residing in private repo on Bitbucket which I moved to GitHub: https://github.com/miroadamy/atgdiagram
What it does Groovy scripts:
 https://github.com/miroadamy/atgdiagram/blob/master/src/listATGModules.groovy https://github.com/miroadamy/atgdiagram/blob/master/src/ATGModule.groovy  that scan local ATG installation, discover modules and generate the PlantUML file representing it, for example - https://github.com/miroadamy/atgdiagram/blob/master/uml/test2.uml

      <description>The idea / motivation In order to run VisualVM from predefined configuration you need to point the app to the user directory. This directory takes about 20MB, but 90% of the the content is actually generated or repeated.

      <title>Storing sensitive information in Git</title>

      <guid>https://miroadamy.com/posts/2017-05-15-sensitive-git/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this is to evaluate options and suggest possible approaches for handling the sensitive information in Git repositories such as database credentials, API credentials, passwords, keys, certificates etc. Joel asked this question a few weeks ago - this is part of Milos&amp;rsquo;s security awareness program.
The issue Git repos store in cleartext all credentials, that may also be including PROD credentials.
Everybody who clones the repository - every developer has access to this information that should have been shared only with the support team that has legitimate access to production.</description>

 The setup (as I understand it):
 on client side we have a worktree that is Git repository the files needs to be copied to SVN regularly  Options Use git-svn bridge Git client allows to &amp;ldquo;pretend&amp;rdquo; it is SVN and pull/push against remote SVN repo</description>

      <description>I was intrigued by convenience of using Docker natively on Mac, without dealing with differences localhost != dockerhost, so I subscribed for Beta and installed it.
Good news 1 It can coexist with previous Docker installation (mostly) - see the note at the end. As long as you do not try to run native Docker and docker-machine at the same time, things coexist.
Good news 2 It works for several images I tried.</description>

      <description>Motivation for this hack is my unwillingness to suffer the pain of using Windows UI just to access BCC, ACC or other ATG tools requiring non command-line interface.
The credit for finding out about approach is blog post by James McOrmond - VPN over SSH - who is using this neat trick from Linux for quite some time.
The software mentioned https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle supposedly works on OS-X, however, it has not been updated for 4-5 years and would not function for me (OS-X Yosemite).</description>

      <description>The ACC is installed in default location: ~/ATG/ACC11.1
This does not work OOTB. You must set 2 additional ENV properties
1 2 3 4  cd ~/ATG/ACC11.0 export ACC_HOME=`pwd` export JAVA_VM=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_51//bin/java bin/startClient &amp;amp;   Starting from dyn/admin The start in separate VM works OK.
Start in server VM brings errors message very often complaining of malformed Help URL. The issue is documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20868244/how-to-fix-malformed-help-url-while-opening-acc-atg - for JBOSS.

      <description>When git uses less as pager the output of commands like git log disappears from the console screen when you exit from less. This is not convenient in many cases so here is how to fix this.
Just for git commands:
1  git config --global --replace-all core.pager &amp;#34;less -iXFR&amp;#34;   For less globally (including git) - add to .bashrc / .zshrc / etc:
1  export LESS=-iXFR   The options we set for less are:</description>

      <description>Question from email:  how do I merge 1 file from master -&amp;gt; LIVE
 Answer You cannot. Merge operation creates new commit that has 2 or more parents and will always join full histories of the branches.
You can however:
 replicate all changes done in single commit to different branch - this is &amp;ldquo;cherry pick&amp;rdquo; take state of single file from different branch into current branch  How to replicate all changes done in single commit to different branch - &amp;ldquo;cherry pick&amp;rdquo; Say you have latest commit in master that contains change to two files you need.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to make this work for about 1.5 hr. Looks like there is open bug - https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-703
Helpful link: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/logstash-users/sZM03po7HJE
What should work:
1 2 3 4 5  grok { match =&amp;gt; [&amp;#34;message&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regex to parse severity&amp;#34;], match =&amp;gt; [&amp;#34;message&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regex to parse server IP&amp;#34;], match =&amp;gt; [&amp;#34;message&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regex to parse user&amp;#34;] }   What needs to be done instead

      <description>Source of the fix is https://github.com/jc7447/BetterDynAdmin. This is to capture the installation process and provide backup in case the tool disappears.
The pages generated by DynAdmin are actually not coming from a JSP or JHTML pages. The HTML you see is generated by hardcoded servlets. Each Nucleus component has assigned Admin servet, which is called when DynAdmin is trying to render the page.
The improvent here are user scripts - running inside Firefox or Chrome, utilizing infrastructure provided by Greasemonkey extension (FF) or Tampermonkey (Chrome).</description>

 Even better - all branches with graph  git log &amp;ndash;oneline &amp;ndash;decorate &amp;ndash;all &amp;ndash;graph
 Highlight words instead of lines  git diff &amp;ndash;word-diff HEAD~~~ HEAD~~
 Also works in git log -p and git show
Better status  git status -sb

Sublime Text This is easy - there is DashDoc plugin - https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/DashDoc
The plugin is OS-X specific, because the DashDoc is

      <description>Case sensitivity and VirtualBox shared folder Weird but true behaviour:
I have the case sensitive encrypted disk (sparse bundle with HFSX type) mounted in VBox shared folders. All works fine, after VM starts:
1  touch zz zZ   creates two files, both &amp;ldquo;inside VM&amp;rdquo; ~/development/ATG/platform-edc as well as in OS-X.
If the VM is suspended and resumed, it looses the case sensitivity inside the VM.

Inspiration for the setup came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=cPt_1Vga-Nk
Motivation - issues with VMs VMs are great - they allow &amp;ldquo;packaged&amp;rdquo; dev environment and quick start for the new member of the team. Start a VM on local or remote host, connect with VNC or Remote Desktop and you are in business.</description>

The cause was by mistake selecting additional language in Properties -&amp;gt; Internationalization (Österreichisches Deutsch) and the system added it to the list as language #1.

Here is how that list looks like after reorder :-) I care only for the first 11 languages anyway ;-)</description>

      <description>I have been experiencing issues with Quicklook (press Space on file in Finder or Pathfinder) for some time: it took several second, sometimes 10-15 to show content of simple 1K large property file.
It turned out that on of the QuickLook plugins, installed originally way back in Leopard and brought ahead with TimeMachine restores could have been the reason: the QLStephen.
For more on that plugin see:
 http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/ https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen  To remove the plugin, go to ~/Library/QuickLook and delete the file (it is the bundle) QLStephen.</description>

      <description>Finally a todo/task/project management system that is very good fit.
Here is why:
 is pretty visually modern and dynamic UI has Web back-end (usable from Linux VM) has decent iPhone app allows checklists (multiple) allows color coding Markdown support ecosystem  There is Gmello that allows create card from GMail, plus few others that seem to bridge the gap between Evernote, System XYZ and Trello

Alloy made custom version of MacVim with file drawer: see https://github.com/alloy/macvim/wiki/Building
It is available in source - so you have to compile it yourselves. But if you do not want to, I did it and the binary is attached, built with these features:
 ./configure &amp;ndash;with-feature=huge &amp;ndash;enable-rubyinterp &amp;ndash;enable-pythoninterp &amp;ndash;enable-perlinterp &amp;ndash;enable-cscope
 Archive is attached: MacVim.zip
If you want to get my set of plugins and customizations, it is on GitHub: - https://github.</description>

      <description>How to setup new client You need to be pensieve admin to do this. You will have to login as service user (non-host account) and su to root.
 create new Linux user on pensieve setup gitolite:  git clone &amp;lt;git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite&amp;gt; mkdir bin; export PATH=$PATH:~/bin gitolite/install -ln  add own public key to gitolite to get access to gilotile-admin repo (note the naming restrictions!!)  gitolite setup -pk miro.pub  get public key for the client account admin and add it (there can be multiple admins) clone the gitolite-admin repo from workstation whose pub key was added  git clone &amp;lt;client@pensieve.</description>

      <description>General setup of code sharing host The code sharing host (Pensieve) is dedicated Linux server in DMZ, accessible from external locations as well as from internal network (dual homed) - for the build server access.
Main features  multiple users each user represent a client:  e.g. users client1   Users are separated by Unix permissions:  access rights to /home/USER are 0700 - no access except the dedicated user only ThinkWrap has root access or sudo access the access via ssh for the user is blocked - the user client1 cannot log in using ssh and get shell, only use git to pull or push changes  Inside each user, there are multiple projects.</description>

      <description>Being two weeks without &amp;ldquo;permanent computer home&amp;rdquo; and living among old Helios, MacMini, temp repair and Web was interesting experience. I certainly remember most of my Web passwords (again).
Got my new MacBook Pro replacement yesterday. Pretty sweet upgrade: quad-core i7 @ 2.4, 8 GB RAM, 750 GB HDD 7200 RPM, Thunderbolt. Noticeably faster but also a bit louder - runs fans more often, maybe it is just while Spotlight does index everything ?</description>

      <description>After I created the ThinkWrap GitHub account and uploaded the public key, this key got somehow bound to GitHub identity &amp;lsquo;madamy&amp;rsquo;
I had to add user madamy to my public GitHub repo - where I keep the dot-files - https://github.com/radegast/dotvim
This may be an issue for people that have their own private accounts - the key management is the key.

      <title>How to make unregistered files work in Quick View on OS-X</title>

      <description>Out of the box Quick View (press Space in Finder) behaviour on unregistered files is not very useful: it shows huge Unix icon instead of content of file.
This is default for files like Makefile or build.gradle
This plugin makes it go away and show text file for all UTIs that are plain text: http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/
Installation: * open the DMG file * copy QLStephen.qlgenerator to /Users/&amp;lt;&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator
That&amp;rsquo;s it.

      <description>Few gitbits to remember Pushing new local branch to remote repo: Find a ref that matches experimental in the source repository (most likely, it would findrefs/heads/experimental), and update the same ref (e.g. refs/heads/experimental) in origin repository with it.
If experimental did not exist remotely, it would be created.
git push origin experimental
This is the same as:
git push origin experimental:refs/heads/experimental
Create the branch experimental in the origin repository by copying the current experimental branch.</description>

      <description>Miro Manifesto Original text of the memo, written in February 2012 and shared with limited audience, until it surfaced up as main them of the planning meeting in December 2012.
This is an attempt to come up with better answers to the following questions:
 what issues and challenges I see on our way ahead from the technology point of view and what needs to be done to address them where do I see my professional and personal career go over next 12 to 18 months and in long run how to best align those two streams  In the spirit of my latest “back to the basics” obsession, it was written in Markdown format and in Vi, copied and pasted into Google Doc, btw.</description>

      <description>Part of the beauty of JSP development is the easy of trying out the change. All you have to do is edit the JSP file, save it and reload the page. Yesterday I got caught by surprise by not being able to do exactly that. I saw some strange behaviour in an EL expression used JSP tag. As it was nothing ATG specific, I decided to try it out in plain old Tomcat rather than full ATG application.</description>

      <description>It may be too early to express opinions about something so new as Google+, but in the short few days I was playing with it, I started to like it a lot. Many bloggers consider it to be a Facebook killer - and it (unlike two previous Google attempts on social networking) eventually may become that. Conceptually, however it is much closer to Twitter than Facebook.
The biggest difference is that in G+ there is no peer relation - &#34;</description>

1) Twitter seems to to become unavoidable - more and more services assume that one has twitter account. Many cyberevents rules start with &#34;retweet this&#34; or &#34;tweet that&#34; which of course one cannot do without Twitter account</description>

Not any more.
I am definitely giving up on Things and Cultured Code products.
The reason why is sheer frustration from long wait on usable synchronization between Things on Mac, iPad and iPhone. Something that have been discussed, promised, chewed over 2 years and that still does not work.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago, I canceled my Twitter account and stopped using Twitter altogether. I do not miss it at all.
The next vector of distraction to be brought under control is Facebook. This is a tougher nut to crack - because of wide variety of people in my circle of friends, Facebook plays many different roles.
 It is a connection to old friends and colleagues from the old continent and old country.</description>

For better or worse, I learn to put up with issues like speed, lack of hotkeys, UI that is not as responsive as it should be, drag and drop that works most of the time. To be fair, in these five years browsers and GMail UI improved tremendously. It was rational decision to trade all these for simplicity of the UI.</description>

      <description>I have came to a conclusion that I do have too much stuff in my life.
Too much and too little and the same time.
Too much information. Too many interruptions and distractions. Too little time to think.
Too much consumption of information and not enough time to process it and do anything meaningful with it - learn from it or create something new.
The only way how to get out of the self-digged hole is to start cutting.</description>

I listen to a lot of podcasts, about 50 % of them produced by Leo Laporte&#39;s TWIT Network (This Week in Tech, Macbreak, This Week in Google, FLOSS Weekly and occasional Security Now).
What I like about Leo&#39;s network is professionalism of audio production, usually good and interesting panel with topics that are worth listening to.</description>

      <description>As regular listener to multiple TWIT Network podcasts (This Week In tech, Macbreak Weekly, This Week in Google, Free Libre Opensource Software, Security Now, Windows Weekly) I am very much aware of all the advertisers that keep Leo and the gang in business and make the podcast&#39;s stream going. I have even acted upon several of the ads: we are customer of SquareSpace.com (the corporate blog runs on that platform), GoToMeeting is regular part of day-to-day business - we have several accounts and use it regularly for meetings.</description>

      <description>It has been one month now that I started to use Windows 7 based Dell Vostro 1320 notebook on daily basis. The hardware parameters of this little thing are: Core 2 Duo 2.26, 500 GB HDD, 8 GB of RAM, 13&#34; screen, Windows 7 Professional (64 bit of course, how else with all that RAM). All this with 3 year next business day warranty for about $1400 CAD - not bad deal at all.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago, first Foursquare application and then my favorite RunKeeper app started to fail. The symptoms were simple:
1) attempt to start
2) wait for for 2-10 seconds
3) exit
Analysis of the crash logs did not reveal anything obvious (see ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/NAME:

      <description>Some companies just do not get it.
It starts with an email, like this one:

By coincidence, you are on project that has the CRM component so you decide to check it out and click on link. After all, it is free, right, so why wouldn&#39;t you ?
The catch is that it is not free at all. Without realizing it, you have already made your first payment, by doing the sender a favor: as we know, clicking on a link in email is definitely not a good idea and recommended behaviour, unless you know the sender and trust the sender.</description>

First thing to start is to explain why did I do something quite contra-productive as relocate the blog and loose all the audience - however small it could have been.
It would seem that I like restarts and things reloaded. I did pick a new country to become new home for me and my family (if emigration is not a restart, what else is ?</description>

This is definitely NOT facebook. How come I ended up on &#39;quiz.us&#39; site when I typed in www.facebook.com. Or did I ? Let&#39;s do it again:</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon this pretty nice little application or service - depends how you see it. It is called reQall (obviously would have been recall, but recall.com as every good domain is taken.
What it does is that allows you to set a reminder in the future to do something - at given time and date: buy X, call Y, do Z. Nothing to earth-shattering about that.
What is neat is the way how you do it.</description>

      <description>From the author that wrote Tipping point (on my reading list) as well as Blink - which I listened to but found rather controversial. I was very curious what will this one be about.
The book is about success and people that managed to achieve extraordinary results. It touches several topics, I will pick three of them that I found most interesting. It starts with interesting observation - if you look at the MONTH of the birth of junior NHL hockey players, you&#39;ll discover that over 50% of them was born between January and April.</description>

      <description>This is public answer to all who were asking why is my blog so badly neglected. Short answer is: It is because I am pretty active elsewhere and did not really find any additional time to allocate. If you are busy person, now you know, see ya later. If you are curious what elsewhere means, read on.
Last year and before, blogosphere and this blog was *only* part of the social networking space I was paying attention to.</description>

In past two month I was involved much more interaction with the requirements, business analysis and project management part of the process.</description>

      <description>The double backup word in the title is not an oversight. If I would be talking about &#34;almost perfect backup solution&#34;, it would be Time Machine - which has proven, despite it&#39;s minor annoyances (see this) to be very unobtrusive and functional. As long as you have Mac and Leopard, of course.
What I am talking about here is second level - an offsite backup, that you may need in case you house burns down, gets flooded or your computer with time machine disk gets stolen.</description>

      <description>Since few months I have slowly switched all my online notebooks to Evernote. In case you are not familiar with it, it is a great service. You can clip pieces of Web pages, type in notes, attach documents and multimedia files (pictures, sounds) and store them online to be always available through nicely done Ajaxian Web interface. The notes can be tagged, organized into notebooks and full text searched. One of the killer features is that for uploaded pictures, Evernote will do OCR and include the photographed tex into full text search</description>

      <description>I first time discovered Ruby back in 2006 (yes, I know, I was late to the game), and immediately fell in love with it. The dynamic nature of the language, the consistency, pure esthaetics and practicality certainly changed the way how I saw software development and programming languages.
Since that time, I made several attempts to integrate Ruby into my professional life and make it part of the toolbox. It was cool to play with Ruby in my spare time, but I wanted to use it on projects whose main development language/platform was mainly Java.</description>

      <description>In theory, exchanging mainboard on Macbook has no impact because all your data is stored on your harddisk that is untouched. In real life, there are few minor surprises.
First, your MAC address of the network card had changed. This is something you will not notice, unless Murphy&#39;s law plays funny game with you, as it did with me. When arriving back to the office, I was able to connect to WiFi network, but the ethernet was stubbornly getting the &#34;</description>

      <description>Back in November 2007, when I was buying Macbook Pro, I did order the AppleCare option, which added several hundred dollars to already pretty expensive notebook price. For moment I was tempted to go without it - after all, Apple makes top grade, high quality hardware and considering pretty low failure rate I have seen with my Windows based notebooks between 1998-2006, why to pay more ? Little did I know how much mileage will I get from the extra cost :-(.</description>

      <description>Here is the context: in order to upgrade iLife 08 to iLife&#39;09 (which is very nice, btw), I had to install 10.5.6 upgrade. And according Murphy&#39;s law, one of the 2 GB DIMM&#39;s in my MacBook Pro went bad exactly during the OS-X upgrade process.
It had two rather unpleasant consequences:
 some of the patch files got downloaded and saved in corrupted state   The machine did not boot back after restart  The second problem was fixed by replacing the bad DIMM, but the first caused that upgrade to 10.</description>

It was not visible immediately, only emails received at 16:20 were shown as received 6 hour in the future.
All this without any changes or installing anything on my end ...
The Clock application showed what was wrong (this snapshot was taken on Sunday, 16:02 Ottawa time):</description>

Beautiful screen, with touch capability.
Nice presentation and user interface.

The keyboard with unique personality.
And after looking closer, it was very obvious why:

Proper keyboard simply must have Command key ;-)

I was not aware of making any changes, but suddenly could not reply to an email, send new email or even forward existing email in the iPhone default Mail application. I am using GMail account and because other clients on different platforms worked OK, I suspected either Rogers or Apple.

      <description>If you want to watch YouTube video on the plane (and Google TechChannel has some amazing collection of videos), here is how to save it to disk, without any tools or third party program, using just your Mac and Safari out of the box.
Go to YouTube page and select video you are interested in in Safari. While playing, press Option-Command-A which opens Activity window. Locate the video stream - it will be the largest item in the list.</description>

      <description>Since few weeks we have started internally use an interesting microblogging tool named Yammer. It works very similarly to Twitter, which means that you are posting very short posts, focusing on the stuff you are doing or working on. Unlike with Twitter, Yammer is company oriented and your posts will be visible ONLY to the recipients that share your company&#39;s email address.
Yammer is free service with interesting business model: everybody can join your company&#39;s network (if that person has proper email address), but to gain administrative rights, you have to pay dollar a month per user.</description>

      <description>Several people asked what is going on with me: no blog posts for almost a month, litlle presence on Gtalk / MSN. It is simpler to answer this way that write same email over and over.
Unfortunately the reason for being quiet is not that I am taking time off and enjoying myself somewhere in Caribbean on a secluded island without internet connection. Those who know me well also know that I would never go somewhere without access to Web for longer period of time than week - and even that would cause serious withdrawal issues.</description>

After some googling around and experimenting (this link was most helpful to point me in correct direction) I found solution that worked for me.
All I had to do was to disable Floppy Drive in the System applet of Control panel. After this, the conversion continued and right now is squeezing 100 GB disk into 50 2 GB files on external USB disk.</description>

I remember telling a friend
that being a project manager
is a little like being a bouncer:
where there&#39;s a problem *here*
and a door *there*
and it&#39;s your job to get the problem out the door.
So
For some a gentle gesture will do
while others need a push
and still others need to be picked up by their pants and carried

      <description>It is always a nice surprise to find something that is free and actually useful on the Net :-). Like this one: a fellow Ottawan Karl Sequin wrote and generously made available as free download &#34;Foundations of programming&#34; eBook.
He touches many topics of various levels from high level design concepts (dependency injection) to low level &#34;Back to Basics&#34; - how memory allocation and pointers work. Especially the later is often neglected and overlooked (and consequently misunderstood) by younger developers who started their education with a garbage collected language such as Java or C# and never were exposed to beauty and horrors of C ;-)</description>

      <description>Few days ago, I have received an email asking to attend the SpringSource conference and offering $300 discount if I decide to buy before end of month. The timining was pretty ironical, considering the recent contraversy about SpringSource Entreprise Maintenance policy change. The was a heated discussion on TheServerside.com and even FAQ was compiled by Rod Johnson to explain the whole thing.
So what is the issue: SpringSource, commercial entity behind community driven Spring Framework decided to capitalize on the investment and push the community toward paid service suport contract.</description>

      <description>I was brave and updated right away last Friday, as soon as the update appeared, both the iTunes and the iPhone firmware. And so far, so good. Initial observations are quite positive - at least so far, from using it during last few days.
I never had any issues with the dropped calls, so I cannot report any improvement. What seems to work better is browsing: I get much less (if any) connection errors.</description>

      <description>Everybody seems to be crazy about Chrome, the new superfast Google browser. The odes on speed sounded quite exaggerated, so I had to try it. I opened up again my old battered Fujitsu Lifebook and after 3 reboots (it was not used for about 2 months and Windows update had to have its patching done) I downloaded and installed it.
The rumors were not unsubstantiated ... it IS considerably speedier than anything else, including Opera.</description>

      <description>One feature that I strongly miss from Objective C are namespaces. Inability to avoid name clash between your classes sometimes really stands in your way.
I am reading S. Kochan&#39;s book &#34;Programming in Objective C&#34; and in one of the examples he creates the class Point. Unfortunately, there already is struct Point defined in mactypes.h.
The solution is easy - rename the darn Point to something like TKPoint ... at least that is what Cocoa naming guide recommends.</description>

      <description>I have started to seriously play with Objective C and XCode about week ago. So far it was very pleasant experience. I really like the language - feels like Ruby (or Smalltalk if you want) with rocket launcher: very powerful, blastingly fast and dangerous like hell. No array boundary checks as in Java :-).
The XCode was not bad experience either. Here my very long Eclipse and Visual Studio history is going a bit in the way, as the things often works quite different.</description>

The Inside Deets on iPhone 2.0.2 and Dropped Calls
http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/08/28/the-inside-deets-on-iphone-202-and-dropped-calls/
Sounds like plausible explanation.
It is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad
power control algorithm in 2.0 and 2.0.1 software and the network that
is at fault. The sooner everybody is running 2.0.2 software the better
things will be. Having seen the graphs the 2.0.2 software has already</description>

      <description>Here is the scoop: I need to provide access to multiple log files spread across multiple directories of multiple machines. For example - the JBoss log files and nohup.out, ATG log files, and so on - so that the testers can see what happened on server side when something looks fishy on front end.
One option would be to write a document that contails IP&amp;rsquo;s of the machines, create user accounts, make sure that they have just enough access rights to see the files but not disturb anything else &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Finally - the new version of Things on iPhone can synchronize with Things on Mac desktop.
It actually works - no strings attached. Assumed that:
1) the WiFi on iPhone is on
2) iPhone and Mac are on same network (so that Bonjour magic can work)
3) the Mac Things is running when you start Things on iPhone
the synchronization happens automatically and is VERY fast (few seconds max).
Finally a portable GTD application that works for me :-).</description>

      <description>Many people recently (including myself) had experiences difficulties with Web access on the iPhone. Quite often the following error message pops up:
Usually repeating the web page access helps. Sometimes you have to try third time or wait few minutes.
This has nothing to do with signal strenght - as you can see, there are 4 bars and 3G is on. I saw it happen on Edge as well. Reseting the phone sometimes helps, but it is hard to say whether because of the reset or time delay .</description>

      <description>Having used Touch 2.0, I managed not to install everything I found in AppStore. Majority of which is crap anyway - people are still learning how to use the platform properly. Pretty soon though, all those flashlights, tip calculators and similar pointless-ware will be replaced by apps that make sense. I hope.
Just for the reference: here is my iTunes snapshot as of today:
Some applications are pure time killers (when waiting in line and there is signal to read news online) but some are actually very useful.</description>

      <description>I just noticed strange thing: it is most likely unrelated, but it happened right after installing 2.0.2 firmware.
The count of updates for AppStore applications is pretty chaotic. You can see different number of updates when looking into different parts of iTunes. I have noticed this cycle repeating for 9 updates, then 8 and so on - here is how it looked when I got down to 3 un-updated apps after few rounds.</description>

1) Run the app you want to get screenshot of
2) Press the home button at the same time as On button. Screen will flash white for a sec
3) Find the picture saved in your photos.
This is second amazing thing I have found out about iPhone in last few days. First was hidden button on the headphone mike that can start/stop running iPod music, pick up the ringing phone or (doubleclick) advance to next song.</description>

It took some time to decide, but at the end I settled for this one:

In white, of course. It is a bit tricky to put it on, but it feels very solid and does not slip.</description>

After doing that, about 1.5 hour later I took out the phone to check the emails. Phone was very warm - not the kind of unpleasantly hot you get from Macbook Pro battery when rendering movie on batery power , but still much warmer than ever.</description>

      <description>One of the many things that I never did before was actually customizing the phone. Neither of the songs that I really liked for ringtone (and were unique enough) were available of course. I found this website: http://audiko.net/en.html that allows to take an MP3 (one that you legally own, of course) and convert it to ringtone.
Here is how it works:
1) Find a suitable MP3
2) Go to above website, upload MP3</description>

      <description>Mac #3 in our household (after Macbook and Macbook Pro):

The beautiful 20&#34;, 4GB RAM, 750 GB HDD, about to replace the old tablet my wife was using and as school computer.
PS: In the excitement of the event I forgot to publish this so it was sitting in Drafts until Saturday. Publishing with original date of the event - for the record. Funny enough, it is almost precisely the 10 birthday of the original iMac.</description>

      <description>Does it work ?
We&#39;ll see - blogging from the train
All the above - including the picture was created and posted on iPhone, using the Wordpress Application (thanks to Peter K. to make me aware of it). I have not used it much, but the first impressions are certainly positive: it works and allows to compose reasonable blog entry, including images on the go. As long as you are fast typist on the miniature keyboard - which I am not, so I will still prefer for longer text the great comfort of Macbook Pro keyboard (probably the best keyboard I have ever used so far).</description>

      <description>There is great site 10 minute mail - which does exactly what it says. Provides you an email address that lives for 10 minutes and then evaporates. For this 10 minutes, you can read any email sent to it on the web page - and eventually renew it for another 10 minutes. Great way how to beat spammers and other email address collecting sites ...
Here is how it looks like.</description>

      <description>This is what I got trying to track my recent purchase from Apple Store ...
That may not be the most useless error message ever seen on Web but it comes pretty close ... One would expect a bit more professional treatment from such big company ...
Why does a company that puts so much emphasis on user experience and perception (like Apple) pick business partners (such as this one - or one certain Canadian wireless provider company running the GSM network) that suck so much that it ruins this perception ?</description>

There&#39;s nothing wrong with me that couldn&#39;t be fixed by a little exercise, some discipline, and a weekend at the Dog Psychology Center.

      <description>Phone
The sound of the iPhone is much clearer and generally better than my old RAZR.
What I really like is a built-in microphone in headphones that allows making and answering calls without holding phone next to your ear. Second is handling of the incoming call while listening to podcast or music: it fades aways and after finishing the call, it slowly fades back in. Very nicely done.
But the best phone feature is seamless integration with my address book, which thanks to synchronization that works very well always the same as address book on my Mac.</description>

      <description>This Sunday, as every first Sunday in month we had regular Bytown Mac User Group meeting at usual place - Patty Bolands Pub at the Market. It was great meeting because we had many newcomers - both to the group as well as to the platform, including very fresh Mac switch - a happy owner of 24 hours old Macbook Pro.
The presentations were very suited for the audience of newcomers, especially Katheryne&#39;s demo on customizing the Mac.</description>

Email
My email information was transferred from Touch as part of the activation process and started to work right away. Very good and functional user interface.
I also found the mobile Google page (http://www.google.com/m) to be very useful - it adds easy access to small screen optimized versions of the Calendar and Reader. I use Reader a lot, the best feature being that articles I read on ANY device (MBP, Linux desktop, iPhone or even some of the many VM&#39;s I am using)</description>

      <description>There more than enough reviews and opinions on the coolest gadget in the telephony space so what is point o adding another one ? I was originally quite anti-iPhone anti-Rogers for - IMHO - pretty strong reasons, so it is interesting to review them and see how they survived the reality check.
That maybe not be the strongest reason ... but am going to do that anyway.
Activation
I have ordered the phone by calling the 1-888-ROGERS1 and as I mentioned, the shopping experience was for a change a great one .</description>

      <description>I was holding off for over two weeks, decided not go with that outrageous iPhone voice/data racket. Even trying to encourage people to wait in a hope the demand will be weak and Rogers will bend and lower the rates.
Only, it was not. I mean demand. iPhones seems to be selling better than beaver tales on Dow&#39;s Lake during sub minus twenty sunny skating Saturday. Especially the 16 GB ones.</description>

      <description>It was very interesting to observe during last few weeks - since WWDC announcement - the wave of expectations building up here in Canada. After all, we will finally officially have the iPhone and will be allowed to join the family of first-category nations, legally iPhonized, blessed by his Steveness himself. Selection of Rogers as carrier was no surprise. Rogers is only company that (IMHO) actually can run 3G iPhone - at least around here in Ontario / Quebec.</description>

      <description>I still remember back in 2003/2004 when Rod Johnson wrote his books &#34;J2EE Design and Development&#34; and &#34;J2EE programming without EJB&#34; and presented his POJO based inversion of control framework - at that time, still packaged as com.interface21.* - that eventually evolved to Spring Framework.
Idea of composing J2EE application from basic Java Beans, that were instantiated by the core container that managed their lifetime and resolved references was for most people really an eye opening experience, true Aha!</description>

      <description>A comment got to me via friend mentioning why am I suddenly so negative about Apple and Macs, which quite surprised me. True, I have had some serious hardware issues in first two weeks of June, but this negative event was about as much positive experience as hard disk crash can be.
Thinking back what I have learned and discovered from this:
- Time Machine actually works
- it pays to plug in the firewire disk with Time Machine backups every day - the two second operation saves a lot of time in long run</description>

      <description>So, after few days working diskless, I am back to normal operation mode. About time, we are late with last episode of screencast ...
The copying of external disk went error free and took almost 5 hours (210 GB). Fortunately, the MBP was usable - I did not want to modify too many files, but it was perfect for Web research and writing in Google Docs.
After reboot, the TimeMachine decided that 85 GB needs to be backed up again.</description>

      <description>So, I have positive proof that the file system crash of last week was not a software problem in Leopard, but indeed caused by hardware failure. After restoring system from Time Machine, things looked pretty good - everything seemed to work. I was able to re-render the screencasts I have lost - I mean I have lost converted AVI files and MP4 files, not the &#34;source&#34; MOV files. I worked on Mac over Saturday and Sunday.</description>

      <description>It happened on Wednesday afternoon. I knew something is wrong with my MacBook Pro immediately - when I saw semi-dark screen, unresponsive machine - even mouse cursor was frozen - and heard fans blowing full speed, making the strange, clicking noise coming from inside almost disappear ...
OS-X does not freeze too often, but it can happen and as a matter of fact, I have seen it happen before during my almost two years with Mac, so I did not panic.</description>

      <description>I have got a letter from Online Rights Canada. I believe that what is about to hapen, may have pretty deep implications down the stream. Minimum thing I can do is try to help spreading the word.
Here is the message:
Dear Online Rights Canada Supporter,
We understand that the government will imminently introduce legislation to amend the Copyright Act - and it intends to push it through quickly. We at Online Rights Canada wanted to let you know what was ahead in the next few weeks, and what you can do to protect Canada from a new DMCA.</description>

      <description>I had the pleasure to listen very interesting podcast where Scott Hanselman and Quetzal Bradley discussed unit testing named &#34;Testing after Unit Tests&#34;. To increase the Google Karma of the information discussed I have decided to rehash and sum up few main ideas of this discussion.
Quetzal introduced the idea of &#34;negative coverage&#34; - meaning that if you have 88 % test coverage, you should not see this as something positive you have achieved, but as something missing (you miss 12 % of completion) - thus the title of this post.</description>

From the error report (thanks for that) the problem was in missing dependency Oxygene framework - a module similar to Windows DLL. Here is the error message:

      <description>As if the yesterday&#39;s Firmware update issue was not enough, I had very strange experience with iMovie 08. Suddenly, for no obvious particular reason the user interface became very unresponsive, I was not able to select project in project library. Switching Event library and Project windows on or off stopped working. Windows were not redrawn properly. Creating new project had no visible effect. I could not click on project to select it (well, technically I *could* click, but nothing happened).</description>

      <description>Today I (finally) found out that Apple pushed the long expected Java update with Java 6 for OS-X. Together with this update was another one - Firmware update. I installed both, but on next login, the same firmware update showed up again and checking the firmware version with System Profiler has shown that it was not updated.
So I installed firmware update again, and rebooted. But nothing happened again.
After some googling, I found out that the Firmware update - unlike all other updates does NOT really install itself.</description>

      <description>as long as you are Safari Books online subscriber - see it here.
Completely updated with XCode 3.x and Objective C 2.0. The screenshots even show the iPhone project templates, indicating the XCode 3.1 in some places. So far the only difference against reality I have found is not covering the XIB resource format (which is generated by default) and sticking with NIB. This blog entry has good explanation of the difference.</description>

      <description>I do not blog on political issues, but this one is kind of different.
Couple of weeks ago I received a letter from my ISP provider (Rogers Cable), stating that days of unlimited downloads are over. More or less. Rogers capped the monthly transfer depending on your subscription plan, which in my case means maximum 95 GB / month for sum of upload and download.
They started to monitor the traffic in December and will start charging for the transfer exceeding the cap in June.</description>

      <description>What does really big mean ? In my case few hundred megabytes, up to 1 GB. Clearly, too much for email attachments - most providers caps them at around 5-15 MB.
Since we started doing screencasts, I need quite often to transfer work in progress - screen recordings, rendered MOV files between me and my co-host of the screencasts. I tried to upload the file to the company servers using VPN, but the speed of the secure uploads is nowhere close to being practical.</description>

      <description>I am using OmniGraffle for most of my diagrams. OmniGraffle is an OS-X platform replacement for Visio - only easier to use and better looking (in my opinion). On rare occasions I do not work on my notebook, it is quite useful to have free alternative that allows to create a diagram that does not look too awful, without going through the hoops of downloading and installing software. The bubl.us is exactly that tool.</description>

Suddenly, for no obvious reason, the top menu became unavailable and cursor changed to beachball every time I moved it there. The Bluetooth mouse stopped responding. Finder stopped responding. All symptoms as if Finder would hanging ...
The cause of the issue was crash of unrelated application (iShowU, if you are curious), which brought up the crash report window.</description>

      <description>Introducing code review and pair programming has often an impact on relationships in the team - especially when a critique needs to be delivered. It takes great degree of experience on both sides to communicate defects in the code for both the reviewer as well as for the code author to get something useful out of it.
I found this at http://www.finetix.com/blogs/finetixblogs.html which can be helpful (page is 404-ing now, but I luckily saved it in Google Docs way back) :</description>

      <description>Spam has always been a big problem for all blogs. Fortunately, worpress.com provides wonderfull Akismet spam filter which is works amazingly well. I do have switched on moderation for all comments, to make sure no spam gets through, but without Akismet it would be impossible to manage it because of the spam volume. Since I started this blog (August 2006), it caught over 17&#39;000 (yes, seventeen thousands) spam posts. In other words, about 30 spam comments a day or almost 60 spam comments per published post.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended one day event organized by Microsoft named Heroes Happens Here. It is series of introduction targeting new products: Windows Server 2008 (not out yet) SQL Server 2008 (not out yet) and Visual Studio 2008 (out and well).
I do not do much Microsoft development these days - my world is currently rather unevenly divided between Java (about 70 %), Web-ish technologies (XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, some Ruby) and OS-X (Objective C) which I am trying to squeeze in and get finally started.</description>

      <description>It happened few days ago for the first time: after opening the lid on my MacBook Pro, the machine woke up, but the screen stayed dark. Whatever I did, I just could see cursor and nothing underneath. I had to resort to unthinkable - reboot :-(
Some research showed this is known problem - which is from certain point of view good, because many people found hopefully many workarounds. The more information can be found here, here and here.</description>

      <description>There is a saying that necessity is the mother of invention. Such necessity happened last week and forced me to try out the Groovy language.
The trigger was need for creating good data set for testing changes in a full text search. I had to locate few hundred of obsolete technical documents to be used as test data, dump the metadata as well as the BLOB data to disc, create INSERT sql scripts and loader that would from Ant pre-load the database with the test set and insert the BLOB&#39;s.</description>

To be completely fair, I did have experienced an occurrence of something similar twice in last moths: after wake up from sleep, the screen was collection of the color pixels, completely unreadable. After reboot, everything was normal.
I found out that the issue may be related to the &#34;safesleep&#34; mode. For now, I disabled the mode by</description>

ORA-29907: found duplicate labels in primary invocations
after testing the change request we have implemented recently. The error message was not very helpful - I was not exactly sure which labels and which invocations ;-) - and as Oracle guru who actually does understand fine details of Oracle Text was visiting sunny India, I was on my own.
The change addressed an issue in repository search: users were asking for more flexible processing of full text search phrases: instead of e.</description>

      <description>After some break, I got back to Rails land. The return is not as smooth as I hoped: since Rails 2.0, many things work differently and quite a few steps learned from &#34;The Book&#34; do not work any more. The issues are more often than not quite easy to fix, but there is quite a few of them.

      <description>After some break, I dusted off the Ruby to try out one interesting idea Peter presented yesterday that literally ASKS for Rails. So I grabbed the latest and greatest RubyNetBeans from Ruby Hudson. For some reason it stopped updates on January 26th so the latest version I have got was build 6327. It is bundled with JRuby 1.1RC1 and the Rails version that comes preinstalled is 1.2.6. Using the menu Tools -&amp;gt; Ruby Gems, they can be easily upgraded to latest and greatest 2.</description>

If the number was 4, the next would be snowblower. Up to yesterday, our family was in safe position being equipped with several shovels, four or five scratchers and one pusher.
Then disaster stroke: my son broke the pusher while moving away few cube meters of snow we removed from the roof.</description>

It addresses the issue how to easily tell which version of the Web application is running as well make sure that the same version is reflected in the snapshots performed by Ant.

The version I talk about is not the automatically generated version from VCS system (such as SVN revision).</description>

      <description>Testing applications that communicate using email is more challenging than e.g. testing database access. Thanks to GMail and Spring, it can be done pretty easily.
Here is the scoop: I need to generate email notifying users about business events and after sending the email, store the content in the database. In real environment you will use corporate SMTP server and real email addresses of real people.
For development we can avoid bothering and spamming our customers by few simple tricks.</description>

      <description>Part of the configuration magic is (one of several) Spring post-processors, that allows load the property file or files and refer to the values in these files inside XML configuration files. The rationale behind these is that property files are much easier to edit that possibly huge XML config file and using property values prevents repeating same value over and over again. With this approach, the following configuration:

It gives you much more power when it comes to manipulating data or managing database. I use most of the time MyEclipseIDE plugins, but when I need e.g. export data, the SQLDeveloper is way to go.
Today I tried it for first time on the Mac. I started to configure and database connection and was completely confused by the error message &#34;</description>

It focuses on Java 5 features and addresses both Web applications as well as GUI apps - each group having their own share of concurrency related problems
Here is the Amazon page for the book - check the reviews. There is also a sample chapter available on the book&#39;s website.</description>

      <description>I am having the pleasure working with Spring 2.x since about October last year. It is my return back to Spring, after first encounter in 2005 (counting only larger projects). Same as in previous project, it has been so much fun :-). So much fun in fact, that I was spending my evening playing with code and reading up what is new in 2.5, rather that blogging ;-)
I am still amazed about how nice is the whole thing designed and how many ways it can be used.</description>

      <description>This one took some time to figure out - it is one of those problems that are obvious after you know the solution but hard to see beforehand.
I had the ResourceBundleViewResolver configured with Tiles 2, like this:
[code language=&#39;xml&#39;]
[/code]
and the view.properties was:
[code language=&#39;xml&#39;]
parent-view.(class)=org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView
parent-view.(abstract)=true
about.url=/WEB-INF/jsp/about.jsp
form.url=/WEB-INF/jsp/form.jsp
list.url=/WEB-INF/jsp/list.jsp
[/code]
It kept givin exception saying that /WEB-INF/jsp/list.jsp does not exist. Which it did. I tried couple of things, no result.</description>

Data layer of the current project is based on iBatis and Spring DAO. We have decided to try out the Abator tool from Apache (part of the iBatis suite) to generate initial version of data mapping (as we inherited the database schema).</description>

      <description>Of course, I mean the other Steve, Steve Jobs. My world is revolving around few Steves. Steve Jobs is usually Steve Nr. 2 - and no, Joel - the Steve #1 is definitely not Ballmer :-). But every year, for two brief occasions - Macworld and WWDC - Steve Jobs becomes Steve #1 for very large amount of people.
I was waiting with this post full day to allow the new-ity of the keynote sink in and reality distortion field to evaporate .</description>

      <description>Continuation of this post.
As every TiddlyWiki, the main building block of the MGTDTW (MonkeyGTD TiddlyWiki, if you are wondering what kind of monstrous acronym is that) is a tiddler. And the only one building block because everything is a tiddler. How does this map to the GTD approach ?
The GTD workflow works with projects, contexts and actions. Action (or task or todo) is smallest building stone. The actions in GTD are really small actions.</description>

Within my how wireless network, I can have an access to the videos on YouTube without sitting behind the computer - for example while walking on treadmill (I recommend walking slowly) or on a sofa :-).
Very interesting videos and actually worth the time spent on them are Google technical talks from Google channel. Few examples of videos I watched and liked:</description>

      <description>Thanks to Kovid Goyal, the Sony Reader&#39;s very own terrible software (iTunes wannabe) can very soon be decommissioned from my software collection. The libprs500 project, multi-platform solution written in Python works very well and allows to move data between Sony and your Mac / Linux / Windows. The UI is actually pretty decent, considering that it is not native Cocoa app:
You can also edit metadata, which is very important because of the limited screen space on PRS500.</description>

      <description>Did you notice that there are seasons for software as well ? Similarly as with other merchandise, there are times during the year when many more people suddenly decide they need that one application X. Luckily, this trend is not as extreme as with e.g. Santa hats or carved pumpkins, which are impossible to find in stores outside of the narrow window around Christmas and Halloween (I am grateful for that :-)).</description>

      <description>I am experimenting in JRuby and use database in virtual machine (VMWare Fusion). This is great because you can have multiple versions of multiple databases ready without polluting the notebook. One downsize though is that IP address of the database will change between the VM restarts.
First important setting in Fusion is to use the &#39;NAT&#39; option rather than &#39;Bridged&#39;. With NAT, you database host IP address will not follow the network.</description>

- Introducing Microsoft LINQ by Paolo Pialorsi and Marco Russo
- Introducing ASP.NET Ajax by Dino Esposito
- Introducing Microsoft Silverlight 1.0 by Laurence Moroney
Silverlinght 1.0 is probably a bit outdated (with 1.1/2.0 close), but the others should be good, judging by the authors. Dino Esposito wrote couple of very good books on ASP.NET and .NET.

      <description>It is a tradition to do crazy and wild things on New Year&#39;s Eve. Some people play with fireworks and other noise making devices, other tend to celebrate the end of year by partying and drinking. I am not big fan of explosives and to sacrifice too many neurons to honor randomly chosen point on Sun&#39;s orbit sounds like a pretty silly idea. But still, I wanted to do something out-of-line on December 31st.</description>

      <description>A friend asked me this question today - and here is my take on it (slightly expanded) answer to his email :-):
Hi Shane
I have purchased the 8 GB because I had no choice - the 16 GB versions were sold out at the Futureshop at the time, and I was too impatient to wait for two more weeks until delivered from Apple Online store :-).
From usage perspective - whether 8 GB is enough really depends how much video you plan to put on.</description>

      <description>I was experiencing the occasional weird behaviour on downloading large files in Leopard: the download would stall, but after stopping/restarting (which can be done in Safari and iTunes), the download would continue. It was not very consistent, and I suspected the NAT router or even Rogers - some sites were occasionally having this problem, while other sites would not.
While playing with JRuby over the weekend, this happened again and pretty much prevented the gem installation - because the multi-megabyte gem index would not download from http://gems.</description>

      <description>in case you have not noticed - Interface21 aka SpringSource (great name change, btw) runs a blog with lots of hidden treasures inside.
Recent article describes new addition to Spring portfolio which is territory within my &#34;watched space&#34;: enterprise integration. See the blog entry for more.
If you are in corporate space that is keen on &#34;standards&#34;, the comparison of Spring vs EJB3 is very good article as well. Not that EJB would matter too much these days (IMHO) - but a nice read nevertheless.</description>

I always saw it as less developed, dead-end version of C++ that has little perspective - despite that GCC supported it since early days.

The sale is on for 4 more days. The way how it works is that at certain marks, additional applications will be added to the bundle (for the same price) and will be made available to everybody who purchased the bundle.</description>

      <description>Today I got to trying out the major feature of Leopard: the Time Machine. I was postponing it because I did not have proper external storage. Although I do have several USB disks sized from 100 to 260 GB, they are not empty and to clean them would take too much time that I currently do not have. Backing up on network drive would be technically possible - with some tweaking - but copying over network is always slower than USB2 or FireWire.</description>

      <title>iPod Touch: the best PDA I ever had</title>

      <description>Why did I arrive to this conclusion so sudden ? After all, I have the iPod for over a month and half now and never really used it for anything beyond podcasts/music/videocasts.
The answer is simple: 1.1.2. The Firmware update that appeared during last sync upgraded the iPod to latest version which (in addition to obligatory bug fixes) brought the long needed possibility of adding an event or modifying an event in calendar or adding/modifying an address card.</description>

      <description>As time passes, I am discovering more little features that either fill in the still existing gaps from my Windows toolchain or add new features. Today, at Apple presentation about Leopard Client and Leopard Server I have heard great tip.
The QuickView in Leopard is extensible with plugins. One very obvious and very useful plugin is ZIP View that gives you content of the ZIP file in preview without unzipping it.</description>

      <description>no, not because of the memory it takes or CPU cycles burned (does not really matter when you have 4 GB notebook with Core2Duo).
Few days ago, a good friend from old country (well, technically not anymore as he also moved within the EU) made me aware of this presentation &#34;Silver Needle in the Skype&#34; (link points to fairly large PDF file) by Philippe Biondi, &amp;amp; Fabrice Desclaux.
To fully digest and fully comprehend the content requires way more time than I am willing to invest - and to make meaningful arguments for or against conclusions does require much deeper special knowledge.</description>

      <description>Today I picked the printer I have mentioned yesterday - Xerox Phaser 6120N. It is somehow more bulky than the ML-4500, but boy, does it work !! From all available connection options (parallel port, USB, ethernet) I have of course chosen ethernet. Printer after switch on spent about 5 minutes doing strange and weird noises, initializing itself and then spit out a page with its DHCP-acquired network address.
To assign different IP address (so that it does not change) was very easy: go to http://192.</description>

      <description>I have been running the Unix only workstations for over a week now. During this week, I have managed to clean up and convert two Windows boxes to VMWARE virtual machines, but actually had to resort to use the VM&#39;s only in two cases. Everything else worked just fine.
The first case was requirement to review an non-trivial Excel file. Normally, Numbers does very decent job when it comes to loading Excel files and for the most the remaining cases, the OpenOffice (in it&#39;s more polished Cocoa version NeoOffice) works just fine.</description>

      <description>Today is a special day for this blog as two bit boundaries were crossed. This is post number 256, which means that I have used all 8 bit numbers for numbering and jumped into nine bit space. The byte is not enough any more - vive la 0x100.
Another boundary crossed today is number of hits as tracked by Wordpress (which does not count my visits). In this case the number reached and crossed was 0x8000 or 32768 decimal, which brings us to upper half of the 16 bit address space.</description>

      <description>On previous weekend I had great opportunity to spend a lot of time listening to books and podcasts. The opportunity was long drive to Quebec City and back, plus the two days spent walking around with camera, taking pictures, enjoying the differences in style and architecture and listening to Seth Godin&#39;s book - Small is the new big.
There is nothing in this book that would actually require to drive almost 500 km one way - you can comfortably get the same benefit out of it without moving out from your favorite sofa, walking around your neighborhood or on a treadmill (hi Joel).</description>

      <description>I have already worked through full week solely on Mac and Leopard platform with excellent results. The productivity in using Java is actually higher, thanks to faster machine and Spaces allowing to have opened few Firefox windows with Spring documentation, terminals for Ant builds, Tomcat, Eclipse and Spype/Adium to keep in touch. Spaces is about as good as having multiple monitors - the ability of switching between both with mouse and keyboard fits well in my working habits.</description>

      <description>Last year, when I got my first Mac, it was a wild ride of discoveries and trying out new software. As result I have ended up with many programs installed that I do not really need or use. Fortunately, the uninstall process is as simple as install and there is no registry that could get corrupted, so it was not really a big deal. With the new one, I am going to be much more selective what I put on the harddrive and what not.</description>

At the entrance, there was a poster showing smiling Finder&#39;s face, Apple logo and announcing reasons why you would want to make the big jump - il grande salto - to Mac platform. That is to explain the title :-)
Grande Salto is exactly what I did. Without too much preparation or notice. Since Tuesday evening I am happy owner of the beautiful piece of hardware (17 inch 2.</description>

      <description>The combination of 17&#34; screen with Leopard&#39;s visual appeal is pure beauty.
Unlike assumed, the Leopard does NOT (yet) come preinstalled on hard disk. There is a DVD which will install it. I have decided to erase everything and start from scratch. The install took about 45 minutes and had zero problems. The only confusing part was that after erasing harddrive you also erase iLife and need to reinstall it. On the Web site, Apple shows an image of two DVD&#39;s - Leopard and iLife&#39;08.</description>

      <description>I am in the middle of a non-computer related project. Last week we have decided to get rid of carpeting in my home office and library and to put in the hardwood floor. My wife picked the wood and color, I picked the contractor, with my son&#39;s help we moved out the furniture and the renovation started. The most painful thing was shutting down and disconnecting all the computers and servers - only the lonely router is hanging on the wall and suffering the dust and noise of the power tools.</description>

      <description>Since the big meow on Friday, lot of unhappy people had been talking and blogging about how terrible and unacceptable is the absence of the Java 6 from the Leopard. Some post were sounding very dramatic &#34;I would not buy Mac if I only knew ...&#34; - which is a bit silly. The Leopard&#39;s 300 new features were posted and touted and hyped for two weeks. Some of the &#34;great&#34; improvements were actually fairly modest improvements - so it was OBVIOUS that Java 6 is not going to be included because it would definitely make the list.</description>

I managed to wait for whole 5 hours... partly because I was not sure whether the 6PM is local time or Cupertino time - and partly because the Apple store was stubbornly saying that my MBPro would ship with Tiger. At about 10:30 there was a &#34;</description>

The solution is Amazon S3 service (Simple Storage Service), fantastically affordable system to store your data securely on-line. You pay as you go - the size is unlimited and you are charged only for what you store and bandwidth you consume.</description>

What is that funny syndrome ? Many people from information technology (including myself) actually had to learn English twice. During the late teens and university we managed to get reasonable command of written English, so that we could (and did) read the books.</description>

So what is the dip ? It is the strange valley after you start with something, causing that after initial quick success you will get worse before you can get better. Obstacles that you either overcome - or you quit. Seth explains that these obstacles are there for a reason - they separate those who want something badly enough from those who do not.</description>

The impression ? Mixed feelings. Maybe I&#39;ve expected something different. Lot&#39;s of details on internal politics and inner fights, not too flattering portrait of Bill G as control obsessed person with very questionable interpersonal skills. From technology perspective, very little what was both interesting and new.</description>

      <description>As I noticed on Apple Website, the SDK for developing 3rd party applications for iPhone/Touch will be available in February. This solves the biggest problem - offline reading - because with SDK, storing a downloaded copy will be trivial. It also will most likely fix the annoying lack of updatability of calendar and add few more interesting apps.
It is only matter of time until the other eBook formats will be be readable on iPod - such as CHM or PalmDoc (non-DRM-ed version).</description>

As Reg says about popular bloposts
One model for popular writing is that it panders to the reader&#39;s prejudices. Plain and simple. People like writing that validates them and especially their ideas.</description>

      <description>Every software developer will tell you how frustrating it is to trace problem in your application up to the point of third party library call (jar file or .dll / .so - make your choice) - and then have to resort to trial and error exploration, because you have no source code for that particular library module. For this very reason, most developers always prefer working with libraries or toolkits that comes with source code attached - if they have a choice.</description>

      <description>Thanks to sudden memory jump in my iPod (from 4GB Nano 2gen to 8 GB iPod touch) I have enough space to load some books in addition to podcasts. I normally do not like abridged versions, but the weather is getting worse so I do not get enough walking time for full versions. These two were both 3-4 disc long audio books.
The Google Story is interesting if you are into history of computing - because it describes the probably the largest transition in computing history - the evolution of World Wide Web to a platform and the evolution of the company that made the Web actually useful.</description>

      <description>Can you imagine a database table with 25000 (twenty five thousands) columns ? No, not rows, COLUMNS ! Now if you can do that, can you imagine displaying these columns in a datagrid (spreadsheet) on a screen ?
This is exactly what this guy is describing to be his requirements. I hope he did misunderstood or misread the requirements, because displaying 25000 columns on a screen is not only impossible - it is absolutely useless.</description>

After playing with it for about 1.5 hour, I like it even more. The readability of Safari Web sites is excellent - I started to put together some links. Did not try too many sites yet, but the Dzone reads OK :-). Also the PDF book reading is very good - but that is no news.</description>

      <description>No, I have not bought it yet, to big disappointment of Gabo and Shane - sorry guys. I wanted to buy it but all FutureShop stores in Ottawa are hopelessly sold out and on-line delivery is 7-10 business days - which I hope I will beat if these guys get new shipment (maybe tomorrow ?).
I played with two demo pieces though for about 30 minutes, and here are the first impressions:</description>

I wish I could pull similar stunt - but I am not really a good actor and my accent would make it hard to believe. But it is hilarious anyway (video is a recording of phone call and contains text transcription ...). Enjoy.
Thanks to Peter M. for the link. I would link his blog or home page, if he had one :-).</description>

      <description>My current client is multi-national company, headquartered in Ottawa with offices in USA and Europe. With teams all over the globe, the conference calls and network meetings are part of the game. This usually means Microsoft Netmeeting to share the screen and teleconference bridge for voice. Netmeeting usually works quite OK - except when it does not - for no obvious reason :-).

there is actually a petstore, it can be found there:

Some guys used it to compare C-Ruby vs JRuby performance:

      <description>According to the TIOBE Programming Community index (which gives an indication of the popularity of programming languages), Ruby jumped 3 places and made it to top ten. Congratulations !
If you look closely on the trends down on the page, the dynamically languages popularity has risen over 3.6% during year period. Which is A Good Thing (TM).
Should I make my personal Top Ten of the programming languages, ordering languages by my degree of comfort of using the language, the language beauty (which is, in the eye of the beholder ;-)).</description>

      <description>From Scott Guthrie&#39;s interview on .NET futures
SG: We’ve seen demand for an MVC framework on two fronts. One is for even more testability, having the ability to completely mock-up a request. We’ve also always seen with ASP.NET that some people like having the server control, postback model; some people say, “I just want absolute control.”
The MVC framework we’re coming up with is a fairly simple MVC model, it’s very clean, it’s a front controller model, and it integrates very well into ASP.</description>

An obvious solution is to run user script in the browser that will decorate the calendar page - using the fabulous Grease Monkey. The user script to install (after installing the plugin) is here.</description>

      <description>As part of current project I need to test some ORM frameworks and for that, you need a database. In this particular case, database equals Oracle. I need a local instance to be able to work outside of the customer&#39;s location.
On my notebook, I have already installation of MySQL (for all the Rails stuff) and SQLServer (for ASP.NET). Plus few lightweight databases (meaning that they do not really need a server) such as sqlite3, Derby and HSQLDB).</description>

Spent most of Friday night and part of Saturday reading this book. I did not really expect to finish it, considering the size (~ 500 pages) and the fact that I am not such a great fan of Oracle products - especially not the Oracle Apps.</description>

Everything about ebooks and readers - all the stuff I like. See at http://wowio.wordpress.com/
Here I discovered that Sony is assumably preparing new version of reader - PRS 505. From the changes that should be included, none is IMHO really so important. The memory capacity of the reader with SD cards (which are reaching 8GB these days) is much bigger than you ever will need.</description>

      <description>After returning from holidays with completely drained PRS 500 (see field test blog entry), I have decided to test what is the battery life of the fully charged reader without any usage at all. It was easy as I was pretty busy after being away 3 weeks.
The reader was fully charged on 29th of August (24 hrs with wall charger). After that, I did not use it at all, only checked every 2-3 days the status (the reader was switched off except this brief check).</description>

      <description>Part of the technology upgrade in the three Java based projects is also tool update. We have started with Eclipse version 1 and gradually moved up to the currently used Eclipse 3.0. The build and deployment process was based on custom written Ant build script, which compiled, created WAR, deployed, undeployed, run the tests, created source snapshot - you name it. The Eclipse was used mostly as editor and debugger - using JPDA talking to Tomcat started in debug mode.</description>

Obviously, the flight was first moment where Reader was used. During the 7 hours, I spent about 3-4 hours reading.</description>

      <description>Software problems aren&#39;t like mathematical problems. They have no clear boundaries or axioms and the problem domain is always shifting and evolving and changing. This fundamental difference ensures that while mathematical knowledge has a long shelf life, technical knowledge seems to last little longer than most popstars. And the changes wrought in programming are not just shallow refinements or surface innovations but fundamental changes wrought by order-of-magnitude shifts in the virtual landscape.</description>

      <description>During my recent return to Javaland, I have noticed many improvements in newer releases of well established frameworks and toolkits, as well as many new ones. One such new release is version 2 of Spring framework. It is not really a hot news, because the final version of 2.0 is out for almost a year (October 2006), but it is new to me, because I spend pretty much all of last 12 months in DotNet, C# and OLAP worlds, with only brief visits to older Struts based, Spring-free Java projects.</description>

      <description>As the September 28th is approaching (the day when the new iPod touch will be available in Canada), I have a real dilemma: do I go with the &#34;iPhone without the phone&#34; or not ? The price $329 for 8 GB iPod is pretty high - compared to $279 for 80GB classic - which would allow me to carry all my music, some movies and all podcasts with me. On the other hand, the Touch has WiFi and can be used as pretty decent Web browser on top of iPod functionality.</description>

      <description>Hi, all Java gurus inside and outside of Thinknostic - I have a very interesting problem. Imagine the following situation: we have three existing Java Web applications, written back in 2000/2001, based on open source libraries of that time: Struts 0.9/1.0 and JSP 1.x (no JSTL) with Tiles for Web layer, Apache Torque for ORM, early version of Quartz for job scheduling, Jasper Reports for PDF reports and Freemarker as template engine for email creation.</description>

      <description>A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day. &#34;In
English,&#34; he said, &#34;A double negative forms a positive. In some
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a
negative. However, there is no language wherein a double
positive can form a negative.&#34; 
A voice from the back of the room piped up, &#34;Yeah, right.&#34;

      <description>Europe 2007 - 1: Switzerland, Lower Engadin The flight went pretty quickly. It was less than 7 hours, anyway. We crossed the night and the Atlantic in a short time and landed at 6 AM in rainy, wet Zurich.
The car I have retrieved from Europa car was Spanish Volkswagen make – Seat Leon. According the specification, it was a “medium size car”. And it maybe was, for European circumstances.</description>

If I would not consult the map, I would barely noticed the border crossing, because there was no passport control on neither of the Switzerland-Austria or Austria-Italy border. You will not really notice that you have left Switzerland either, unless you notice the prices on gas stations being suddenly in Euro.</description>

The road we took was mostly on toll highways – the directions in Google maps were very useful.</description>

      <description>With the latest software update (I am now on 1.0.3), one of the issues to be fixed was the &#34;charging indicator behaviour&#34;. Looks like it was indeed the software bug. After upgrade, the indicator jumped to full 4 bars and stayed there. Beforehand, I had usually only 3 bars regardless how long it was charged.
Time will tell - I am taking the reader with me to Italy to get some mileage out of it, during transatlantic flight .</description>

      <description>For all my fantasy-loving friends who consider reading in Czech or Polish too inconvenient: the first book of the grand master Andrzej Sapkowski in English is out. It is book of short stories about Geralt, the Hexer (or Witcher if you want), who is the main character of the 5-book saga with the same name.

      <description>Yes, such nice tool really exists and it&#39;s name is Remember the Milk.
At first sight, RTM is not extremely visually appealing, but very nice and very usable Ajax application. After some time using it, you may better appreciate the &#34;less is more&#34; design. The offline access is thanks to Google Gears magic. Just flip the small green arrow (which will download your data to local cache) and voila - you can go offline, keep editing or adding tasks - your changes will be remembered.</description>

      <description>I have been pretty quiet during last month. Few reasons why, none of them business related. The summer is not the season where people in our industry are incredibly busy - that&#39;s what winter is for ... and end of March, government fiscal year end ;-). We had family visit - my two nephews were staying with us for few weeks. So instead of blogging, I was spending evenings with them and weekends as a tour guide around Ottawa&#39;s attractions.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, there was an application named Democracy Player. A really neat one, capable of downloading videos from internet and playing them in multiple formats. It even can download YouTube videos.
For some reason, the Democracy Player name was replaced with a new name. My name. The Democracy Player will be know as Miro. I have not discovered why this name was chosen, or if it means something. Maybe the guys responsible for it had similar thoughts as my parents over 40 years ago :-).</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been over 10 months since we have started to seriously use virtualization and run Windows inside virtual machine to ease installation and configuration pain. It starting first as convenient measure of isolation two different development environments (.NET 1.1 based and .NET 2.0 based) and avoid &#34;crosspolination&#34; in the data analytics project. At that time, my expectations what would be the limits of what you can or cannot do in virtual environment were mostly around performance, responsiveness and device support (USB especially).</description>

Good news is - it really works as advertised and I still like it a lot. I have not really tried many of the features, but what I did try, worked as expected.</description>

      <description>go and get it - at http://www.ghisler.com/
It got nice visual upgrades - look and feel and icons are gently nicer and more XP-ish. Plus many other new features. Upgrade is still free for registered users.
If I should pick one single most useful program I ever used on any computer system, Total Commander would be clear winner. I do not remember when exactly I purchased the license - I guess sometimes around 1994-95, when it was named Windows Commander.</description>

It is pretty tough question to answer. The way this books tries to address it is following the story not very well known open source project named Chandler through it&#39;s beginning over period of 3 years.</description>

      <description>An interesting article on JavaLobby caught my eye today: Do .NET Applications Run Better on Java?

Normally, knowing the not exactly impartial focus of the Java centric site such as JavaLobby or theserverside.com, one should be careful when reading how much Java outperforms .NET. The bias works the other way too - just look at the Theserverside.net or other .NET centric side how much is C# superior :-). With that in mind, I looked atthe technical report.</description>

      <description>One thing that is on my Someday/Maybe list for quite some time is to get some off-site storage for my digital images. They are reasonably safe on RAID-5 NAS with a copy on USB disk, but what is missing is off-site copy. At minimum, a remote backup, ideally with an UI resembling something like Aperture or Photoshop Elements or Shoebox: photo organizer with Web intefarce and remote storage. So that in addition to have offline backup I would have an option to work with images from any location.</description>

Unlike before, it is so much easier to have really good debugger that allows put breakpoints not only into the Ruby code in controllers and model - but even into the RHTML view files !
Netbeans team works hard on improving the tool. With latest build - 2434, I have noticed great addition - Rails console.</description>

Unlike some other screencasts who try to record the screen action as MPEG movie, this one is perfectly legible. In addition to the Rails enlightenment, you can also enjoy the speed and aesthetics of using TextMate - with many great Ruby editing shortcuts and beautiful OS-X typography.</description>

As a very nice surprise, some of the feedback came directly from the people than actually can do something about it - like Darren Parker from Microsoft and Anand Raman from the Sandcastle project. Rob Relyea suggested and interesting looking tool based on XAML.
Thanks everybody - it is always nice to find out that even really big companies listen to the developers and want to address the problems.</description>

      <description>It has been quite some time since I used a Swing based Java application. Compared to beauty and close-to-native feeling of Eclipse based application, Swing just did not feel right - it looked differently and behaved a bit differently. For long time, my desktop was Swing-free (not counting the JDK demo). Not any more, though.
What made me to reconsider, is new release of the Netbeans v 6. In the latest milestone builds (M6 to M9), Netbeans team built amazing Ruby development environment.</description>

      <description>The wild ride is over and the city gets back to normal. I wish we had won the Cup, but - Ducks were playing pretty good and found what worked on our team. Thanks, Alfie and the Sens - for all the great moments. You were fantastic. There will be another season in few months and another chance to bring the cup home.
On the positive side - it is good to have 2-3 more free evenings a week, now - when there is again nothing on the TV :-).</description>

      <title>Strange charging behaviour of Sony Reader</title>

      <description>Despite pretty impressive battery life - which is btw *nowhere* in the range of advertised 7500 page turns - over period of few months I have noted that the charging of the reader behaves kind of funny. Sometimes, even after being plugged-in for 24 hours, the battery indicator stubbornly stays on two squares out of four. Other times, right after connecting, it jumps right to full charge.
It is hard to really measure these things as the battery depletion is very slow on reading and I do not really listen to music on this device (that&#39;s what iPods are for).</description>

      <description>There has been lots of interesting news related to Microsof and Ruby recently, mostly about DLR&#39;s support of dynamic languages. One of my favorite tech authors stirred the waters once again last Friday with an article that goes beyond this and tries to paint larger picture of the uneasy relation between Ruby platform, Agile movement, OpenSource Community and Microsoft.
One quote from the article:
The attitude to open-source is a large part of this problem.</description>

      <description>The support for using dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python to code ASP.NET pages was announced for future versions of ASP.NET in the ASP.NET futures.
Unless I am mistaken, it means that we eventually will be able to write control event handlers in Python or even Ruby - which is certainly more fun than in VB.NET or even in C#, but is it really so important ?
What would be *really* cool if the whole ASP.</description>

      <description>With latest iTunes update, quite silently, a very nice new feature appeared. Apple started to offer for download lectures from many universities, with wide selection of topics: from environment through politics to mathematics and computer science. Most of the lectures are videos, but you will find also audio tracks - albeit for some topics, audio is quite problematic. Can you imagine doing e.g. differential equations in audio-only ?
The best feature - the lectures are free downloads.</description>

at http://blogs.msdn.com/joelo/archive/2007/05/25/you-don-t-blog-i-m-suffering-because-you-don-t-blog.aspx
He makes several very good points - which have very little to do with Sharepoint - but I think the best one is helping the &#34;organic indexing&#34; of the Web space and helping the search engines out there better rank content. I wrote about this while ago.</description>

      <description>It happened! After starting my preferred feed aggregator - Google Reader I have noticed the new feature that sounded so good that I almost could not believe it: offline reading. Using new plugin - Google Gears, the reader can cache 2000 items locally and allows you to go offline and read the news, blogs or whatever you have subscribed to absolutely anywhere.
The installation starts with this screen:

      <description>&#34;Corporate IT is dominated by bloatware. Time and time again we have to deal with expensive software purchased on golf-courses that just get in our way while sucking funds and development hours. Technologies that make it harder for programmers to do what they like to do best - make a difference for the businesses they are supporting. &#34;

      <description>A brief look at my Google Reader subscription list made me aware that I have added to my reading list a loooot of blogs, newslist and so on. Unfortunately, they are not organized very well and should be properly placed into folders. In a process of doing that, I will put some of the interesting blogs here.
For today, it is Frans Bouma&#39;s blog - focusing on .NET and Microsoft technology platforms.</description>

      <description>Wonderful thing about Firefox extensions is the autoupdate feature. Go to Tools-&amp;gt;Extensions, select Find update and for all installed extensions you get the latest and greatest .... usually.
One extension where the update did not work was the Del.icio.us button for Firefox. I was happily using version 1.2 of the plugin and would never found out about the update, if I had not set the new workstation. The latest version 1.</description>

      <description>DHH is (obviously) David Heinemeier Hansson (the creator of Rails) and RIA (in this context) means Rich Internet Applications. And here is the quote:
I think there&#39;s always room for new ideas, but I don&#39;t think that the whole fuss that&#39;s currently going on about RIA, rich Internet applications, is justified. I think we&#39;ve been through this cycle so many times before that it in some ways amazes me how history seems to be ignored.</description>

Visuwords - visual dictionary, showing semantic relations between words.

      <description>I found a handy T-SQL trick that helped to solve the following problem: during datawarehouse creation, we needed to consolidate multiple data sources from databases belonging to two generations of system: older one using int identity keys, the newer one, designed for replication and distributed data scenarios using GUID&#39;s as primary keys.
In the consolidated database, we needed to create single representation that would allow to store both new GUID based identities as well as old int-based keys.</description>

      <description>Even with having Wiki as the main documentation repository, not all documentation ends up in a Wiki. Some documentation needs to be managed as part of the source tree - e.g. Readme&#39;s, compilation instructions and similar. This information is usually either plain text or in some form of text processor format, mostly Microsoft Word compatible. Both have their selection of problems. Word documents are large, bloated, harder to version controlled and not readable in shell environment (try to cat or tail Word document :-)).</description>

Which means that I am doing quite a bit coding and using T-SQL and in addition to Visual Studio 2005, I use quite often the Sql Server Management Studio for SQL Server 2005. In theory, both tools should be based on the Visual Studio IDE code base. Which is maybe true, but there are many quite annoying differences.</description>

Which means I am ready actually start using the framework for real work and become proficient as I get my hands dirty.
To get to this state, absolutely essential and by far the best book is the classic one - Agile Web development with Rails co-authored by the original Rails designer and one of the Pragmatic Programmers.</description>

But exactly this is happening. Somebody is trying to claim exclusive ownership of one number and sending take-down letters, law threats to those you have it posted on their web sites or blogs.</description>

      <description>I had again the not-so infrequent pleasure of setting up fresh copy of Windows development stack. We were moving few machines between projects and to make sure that no forgotten source files are left on the harddisk, we reformatted and reinstalled Windows from scratch. It is usually good idea anyway, because developers like to install strange tools and utilities and generally customize machines to their own taste, which tend to be unique and is seldom shared.</description>

      <description>at least as the programming language languages are concerned. One of the things that will be presented on the MIX07 is Dynamic Language Runtime, a new platform suitable to host high level, dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby. For Python, there is already pretty decent .NET implementation - namely IronPython. What is coming now is IronPython 2.0 based on the DLR as well as - yesss - IronRuby.
It is great that this is happening.</description>

      <description>Running out of Security Now! and TWIT episodes, I have subscribed and started listening to few newly discovered podcasts.
I have started to listen to the .NET specific one from Scott Hanselman named Hanselminutes. There are couple of factors that makes it better that other geeky blogs out there. First reason is the content quality. There is very high signal-to-noise ratio, pretty much all content counts and both guys in addition to being smart are quite good at achieving right balance between keeping on topic and spontaneity.</description>

      <description>The natural gravity of our environment keeps pulling me out of scripting and Ruby world back to .Net zone :-). Out of curiosity, I looked into how easy or hard is it to access other database from Ruby, than the default MySQL which dominates all books, samples and tutorials.
I have found three ways (at least), one likely platform independent and two Windows only. The platform independent requires module ADO.rb and works with the DBI interface.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve ever envied the ability of multilingual friends to bridge language gaps wherever they travel or gained new appreciation for your native language by learning a new one, then you can probably see the advantage of being a programming language polyglot. Developer polyglots travel the IT world more freely than do monolinguists (sure that they can apply their skills in any environment), and they also tend to better appreciate the programming language called home, because among other things they know the roots from which that home is sprung.</description>

They have both purchased and are (mostly) happy users of the Sony PRS-500 aka Sony Reader in addition to several other platforms - (Palm, Pocket PC). In the latest podcasts - both in TWIT as well as Security Now!, the eBooks and eReader got quite some publicity :-).
Both had similar experience with PDF format on PRS-500 as myself - but Steve mentioned the PDF re-flowing the document to make it better suites for small screen - something I have looked into but did not get it working quite right.</description>

      <description>(a followup to discussion last week)

In every outsourced software project you have four large areas: your customer, the business vertical you are writing software for, your implementation team and the technology foundation or platform you are using.
Two of these areas are on &#34;internal&#34; side of your organization (team and technology), two of them are on external - your customer side (business domain and customer organization). Two are more micro level in the sense that they have strong human interaction aspect (customer and team) and two are more macrolevel and less personal (business domain and technology).</description>

      <description>This week was full with attending the demos and workshops. On Tuesday, I spent half day on the Microsoft Unify Tour 2007. I planned to be there full day but an important business meeting made me change the plan. Fortunately, the sessions should be available recorded on the Web, so I will be able to check them later. The topic was bang-on - considering that we are in final phase of large project, using distributed network of SQL Server 2005 installations with replication and location was same as usual.</description>

      <description>YOU should write blogs. 
Even if nobody reads them, you should write them. It&#39;s become pretty clear to me that blogging is a source of both innovation and clarity. I have many of my best ideas and insights while blogging. Struggling to express things that you&#39;re thinking or feeling helps you understand them better.

      <description>A friend sent me link two days ago making me aware that Mozilla decided to change the source code control system (= SCCS) they use. When such large and important project as Mozilla moves ahead and changes something so basic and fundamental to development as the SCCS, there must be good reason behind it. What was even more interesting was the system selected: no, it was not Subversion, but something much less established - Mercurial.</description>

      <description>Another important step forward for all who are looking for alternatives to replace Outlook. With latest Thunderbird 2.0rc1 release it is now possible to add calendaring capability to Thunderbird (using the Lightning add-on) with Google calendar synchronization that works even with iCal invitations :-). Really nice.

      <description>It is a sad news - Kurt Vonnegut Jr., one of the great sci-fi writers, died at the age of 84.
Thanks for all the great hours spent reading many of great books he wrote over last 55 years. I guess that best way how to show respect is re-read something he wrote - like this one.</description>

      <description>This was one great weekend ! Easter should be more often than once a year, I guess. Unlike Christmas, there was no shopping craziness before and much less overeating danger. Not counting overdose of chocolate, of course, but that&#39;s OK.
I managed do mostly nothing for about one day - up to Friday evening. Then I dived into the Ruby and Ruby on Rails world. After reading this and one third of this book, I like Ruby even more.</description>

      <description>I have decided to take weekend off. No catching up, no work, no stress. And it will be a proper weekend - 4 days long in total because both Friday and Monday are statutory holidays in Thinknostic. Great opportunity to relax, decompress, catch up on some reading and audio books and do something fun. And maybe gettogether with friends and celebrate Vlad&#39;s birthday. After all, the 28H is not every year :-)</description>

      <description>.NET 2.0 offers very rich and nicely designed library of core data structures, collections and algorithms. Occasionaly, you run into situation when you need something not in there. Before starting to design you very own extension of LinkedList or HashTable, look into interesting open-source project NGenerics - chances are you will find it there.
It contains quite a few new data structures:

Your mileage may vary - what speaks here is my Java/C#/C++/C/Python/Perl background and bias. Here there are my favorite Ruby-isms (so far) in no particular order:</description>

      <description>Today I have started the walking season 2007. I did some gentle preparation during the week - few short, 4-5 km strolls around the neighbourhood, but it was today when I really started. It was beautiful day in Ottawa - sunny, temperature around 8-10, so I took off and did 12 km loop through Westboro, down south and around Dow&#39;s Lake up to downtown. Just fantastic.

      <description>Man lernt nie aus - as the German say - one never stops learning. Thanks to comment found on my blog I found out that there is very nice solution problem of disappearing emails (after you download it with one POP client, other POP client would not get it). It is even documented in GMail help:
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=47948&amp;amp;topic=1556If you&#39;re accessing your Gmail using POP from multiple clients, Gmail&#39;s recent mode makes sure that all messages are made available to each client, rather than only to the first client to access new mail.</description>

      <description>As Murphy said - you cannot do just one thing. Thanks to JDK 1.4 entering end-of-life support period (and 1.3 being unsupported for some time), we need to move few applications happily running on these antique Java platforms to at least Java 5 and gain few more years of uninterrupted Sun-supported life.
Upgrading the applications was as expected, piece of cake - as long as you have solid build environment with build scripts and everything - which we certainly do.</description>

      <description>There are few technical books which you enjoy first time you read them, remember the experience and keep coming back. One of such classic books is The Pragmatic Programmer - from journeyman to master - by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. If you have not read it, get it, it is worth every cent. Since the book was written - ages ago, back in 2000 - it did not loose anything of its freshness and value - which one cannot say about most of technical books written earlier than 2-3 years ago.</description>

      <description>Since yesterday, I made nice progress in solving my issues with content creation for PRS500 and it&#39;s readability. There are several ways how to proceed:
The simplest is to download Book Designer. It is free for non-commercial use and current version 5.0 Alpha does the job very well. It allows you to load source in text, HTML, Lit, PDF, PalmDoc (prd/prc), rb and few other formats and process them into native LRF format - plus few others I do not really care about.</description>

      <description>After few weeks, I have got back to actually using my PRS500 again and I have finished the books loaded on the device. When I have connected the reader, first the CONNECT software as well as the PRS500 downloaded the updates. The firmware in reader is up to version 1.0.02.0130 from 1.0.00.21081 and should bring longer battery life and stability improvements. It better does, because so far the battery life is nowhere in the proclaimed range of 7000 page turns .</description>

      <description>Now this is something really interesting: as found on Adobe Labs site, their technology codenamed Apollo is approaching Alpha status. What Apollo is - in a nutshell - is another virtual machine, similar to Java runtime or .Net framework, with few minor twists: it is multiplatform (as Java) as well as multi-language (as .Net) at the same time. Before flame wars start - I am aware that JVM is capable (more or less) to support multiple languages beyond Java and also that .</description>

      <description>Often, scientific &#34;failure&#34; teaches you more than success ... An experiment which gives you a clear answer is not a failure; it can surprise you, though. Failure comes only when an experiment answers no question -- usually because it&#39;s been done with ignorance or sloppiness. The true trick in science is to know what question your experiment is truly asking.

It is sort of hidden feature, but very useful one: In Actions you can find &#39;Export in Google Docs &amp;amp; Spreadsheet&#39;. It takes the current notebook and makes it a new document in you Google Docs. All texts, including pictures are transferred. It does very good job in keeping meaningful structure of the newly created document: every note will become an URL heading in document, pointing to the original.</description>

      <description>This year unusually early, we switched the Daylight Saving Time. The clocks did spring ahead one hour on Sunday morning. Btw, this is a good mnemonic how to remember which direction does the clock go: it Springs ahead and it Falls back ... Technically, it was decision of the US legislative to start DST early but because of the integration of the two economies, Canada had not much choice, just to follow.</description>

      <description>My favorite top ten epigrams, for more see http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html
0. One man&#39;s constant is another man&#39;s variable
1. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
2. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
3. A language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
4. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
5. You can&#39;t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</description>

      <description>I have just finished listening to the back-episodes of Security Now! # 38, where Steve Gibson describes his approach to securely browsing Web without antivirus and with Internet Explorer. The idea in a nutshell is - use properly locked down IE zones. Steve has modified the security settings of the default (Internet zone) to maximum: not allowing any scripting, cookies etc. Which makes many sites unusable, of course because increasing number of browsers does require Javascript enabled - or else game is over.</description>

      <description>It has been half a year in March since we have started to use Wiki as main project management, collaboration and content creation tool. I think this is period long enough to look back and summarize what we have discovered, what worked and what not. This was not the first attempt to use Wiki in this context - however, it was first case when the result can be considered full success.</description>

      <description>Thanks to exploring the Google calendar (when playing with public calendars related to Ottawa) I found the Ottawa Mac User group&#39;s calendar and discovered that
a) they exist
b) they hold monthly meetings in nice Irish pub at the Market 
The group is actually named Bytown Mac User&#39;s group, for the reasons explained on the Web site or here.
So I decided to go there. I thought - what the heck, worst thing that can happen that I will have a glass of Guinness at the pub I never visited before, which is not a bad thing at all.</description>

      <description>Gabo sent me this link - it is some half-joke half serious knock-off of the Myers-Briggs personality classification. Same as in case of MB, it gives you four letters. Unlike in MB, the letters are different:
Instead of E/I - Extroversion or Introversion, N/S (iNtuitive / Sensing), T/F (Thinking/Feeling) and J/P (Judging/Perceiving),
it classifies you either as D/P - Doer or Planner, L/H - Low or High level programmer, S/T - Solo or Team programmer and C/B Conservative/liBeral.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer first: I really like GMail. Since I started using it (about year ago), I learned to appreciate the beautiful simplicity and elegance of the Web interface. And since I switched completely to GMail as foundation of all my email systems (about November 2006), I have managed to simplify most of my email related chores. But let&#39;s face it - GMail is far from perfect. Here is list of the annoyances and missing features that I have collected:</description>

      <description>The Ottawa .NET Community organized today interesting lunch-and-learn session: first of two sessions on introducing the Rocky Lhotka&#39;s CSLA Framework. Usual location - Glacier Room at downtown Microsoft Office. I decided to attend for two reasons: first was that I knew the presenter - David Campbell. David is a great guy - consultant with 20 years of history in the software development business, running his own company. Last year when we were looking for people with CSLA experience in Ottawa, David&#39;s name came out first.</description>

Somehow I have completely missed the weekend - so much was happening at work that I had barely had time to notice what is going on on the Web. My Google Reader is overflowing with new links and there are lots of new links in delicious. Let&#39;s start.
Merlin Mann of 43folders started to do videopodcasts - have a look (in the second edition he interviews Jonathan Coulton, famous creator of the Code Monkey song).</description>

      <description>Most programmers love GUI. It is so easy, so convenient, just point and click here, click there, drag and drop, repeat few times and problem solved. Who in sanemind would bother typing and writing code when can GUI do it all. The convenience rules. If you need to add or change something, it takes just few more clicks. Not a big deal, just add a few more easy steps. No problem - right ?</description>

      <description>I have picked it two days ago in Chapters - Code Craft by Pete Goodliffe. Somehow similar in topics covered as the Rapid Development or From Coder to Developer - but newer. Divided into 6 parts:
Part I - At the codeface - defensive programming techniques, naming, formatting, commenting, error handling
Part II - The secret life of code - code contruction tools, testing and debugging methods, building
Part III - The Shape of the code - code design, architecture, source code growth and decay over time</description>

      <description>It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. [Alan Cooper]
And the users exclaimed with a laugh and a taunt: &#34;It&#39;s just what we asked for but not what we want.&#34;
For a sucessful technology, honesty must take precedence over public relations for nature cannot be fooled.</description>

      <description>We build software line by line, idea by idea, side by side. Our software is an expression of ourselves, our best moments, our toughest challenges, our greatest hopes.
 This wonderful quote is from handcrafted copy of Vista, which was distributed to everybody who worked on a product. It is a Microsoft tradition that the people who worked on a project get a copy of the project when it ships.</description>

      <description>Back in old country, I once had a programmer working for me who made himself famous with the following quote:
&#34;I have fixed that bug, do you want me to compile it too ?&#34;.
 In his mind, he was done as soon as he identified the bug and put the fix in the code. All the rest was trivial and unimportant routine.
During last 20 years I have worked with many very different developers and learned the hard way, how very many different meanings the word &#34;</description>

      <description>Continuing from here.
 Ch-7: Digging into the source code
In this chapter, Mike describes the tools that work with, around or towards source code: Idlasm, Reflector and FxCop. The book is written for Visual Studio 2003, so some references are slightly outdated - but there is one utility that stands out and is still more useful than ever: Lutz Roeder&#39;s Reflector. It is part of the Visual Studio 2005 (albeit in older version that you can get on the Web site).</description>

A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of this price. What is his profit?
1970 (Traditional)
A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production
is 4/5 of this price, or in other words, $80. What is his profit?
1970 (New Math)
A logger exchanges a set L of lumber for a set M of money. The cardinality of set M is 100 and each element is worth a dollar.</description>

      <description>I have recently picked very interesting book that I have read about year ago, from Mike Gunderloy named Coder to Developer, with subtitle Tools and Strategies for Delivering Your Software. It is an excellent book and I highly recommend to give it a look if you are in software development business on Microsoft platform. Easy read, practical, useful.When I was reading it back in 2006, it was before we have set up own development lab and started the biometric project.</description>

      <description>Few of my favorites:
Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. [Alan Kay]
Hofstadter&#39;s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#39;s Law.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</description>

      <description>Connie, our HR director came few weeks ago with interesting idea: give the team a chance to get better understanding of &#34;implementation details&#34; of their very own &#34;inner software&#34; - the personality type evaluation using Myers-Briggs approach. Connie holds certification for this type of classification.
The classification in a nutshell, assigns to everybody four letters, one from each pair: E or I, N or S, T or F, J or P.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday evening, the Ottawa Dotnet Users Group organized presentation of Adam Machanic from Boston with title &#34;Designing Highly Concurrent SQL Server Database Applications&#34;. I was not sure whether I will make it, because because I did not feel really well, but I am very happy I went.
It was probably one of the best presentations I have seen in Microsoft Glacier Room on 100 Queen Street. I am not sure whether because it was indeed so great or because it touches closely what we are doing.</description>

Some nations have their own actors

http://www.apple.com/jp/getamac/ads/
Other have only just language version of Long &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Hodgman act

http://www.apple.com/fr/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/it/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/es/getamac/
The Austria and German speaking part of Switzerland are using German version of the ads (no surprise there) - http://www.apple.com/chde/getamac/ - and the francophone part of Switzerland uses the French version. As it looks like, Italian and Romansch speaking Swiss do not count :-(</description>

      <description>After lots of attempts (see here, here and here), I have finally resolved my disk space problems and the RAID-5 NAS server is up and running since about two weeks now. I have stayed with Fedora 6, successfully installed Samba, configured the shares and copied all family JPEG&#39;s, videos, MP3&#39;s etc onto the huge 907 GB large RAID5 share. The old NSLU2 is still dead - I did not have any time to try to re-flash it, but all content of it&#39;s disk was without any issues readable by the new server (the NSLU2 was using ext3 filesystem) so I did not even have to try to use backups.</description>

      <description>Depending on how you define success, you may get different answer to the question above.
If you choose for the success criteria:
- amount of money made by programming AND
- number of people using the product AND
- impact on the community at large
the answer is probably Charles (Karoly) Simonyi, Hungarian born ex-Microsoft employee, billionaire, astronaut and original author of Microsoft Word.
True, there certainly are people that made more money than him and their fortune is closely related to software - but unlike Simonyi none of them was actively programming for major part of their career.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve stumbled upon this page, full of math jokes. Many of them are IMHO really good and extremly funny (your mileage may vary, though).
My favorite few:
Two male mathematicians are in a bar. The first one says to the second that the average person knows very little about basic mathematics. The second one disagrees, and claims that most people can cope with a reasonable amount of math.
The first mathematician goes off to the washroom, and in his absence the second calls over the waitress.</description>

      <description>1) Bruce Schneier
Bruce is author of several excellent books on cryptography, from very easy, thriller like read to a classic work Applied Cryptograhy (highly recommended). The blog goes back to 2004 and is fascinating read.
2) Paul Thurrott
Paul is the Windows guy from Windows Weekly podcast (recommended) who also runs the Winsupersite . He is one of the few people who focus on Microsoft technology and still keep balanced, fair view of the affairs.</description>

      <description>However I like the Web applications, the fact is that as soon as you do not have connectivity, they are of very little use. Well - maybe not for long. The Dojo Offline Toolkit makes promise that sounds almost too good to be true:
Imagine a version of GMail with a “Work Offline” button on the left-hand side of the screen. When pressed, GMail downloads 100 of your most recent emails into Dojo Offline, including pieces of it’s user-interface.</description>

      <description>In software industry there are no annual awards and recognitions of achievements that would resemble the Annual Academy Awards of the movie industry. Various magazines, publishers and companies do present theirs yearly list of Best Products, but they are often biased and seldom representative. The one list that stands apart and that in my opinion comes closest the Oscar is Jolt Awards published by used-to-be one of the best magazines for professional programmers - Dr Dobbs Journal.</description>

      <description>Time to clean up the link cache once again.
Obviously, most of the news on Techsites are Vista related. Web Worker&#39;s daily gives you 10 reasons why to upgrade to Vista and 10 reasons why not. MacHouse comments on complicated upgrade paths and Brian Briggs offers decision chart for the updgradees.
General spirit - compared to the launch of Windows 95 - is fairly cynical. The italian Mac bloggers sums it up: Niente di nuovo in Vista.</description>

      <description>As the tittle says, Fedora Core 6 is it. Everything is installed, everything works. The box is very fast, Samba network server is visible on all computers - I have not had time yet to do some tests on access and write speed. I have 930 GB shared space on RAID 5 which is in process of being subdivided into separate shares for video, images, music, and so on.
Installation was really nice and I was very pleasantly surprised how huge progress did Linux made since 2000 when I last time was really spending some time on it (I was always using Linux as file server and Webserver, but since year 2000 never actually was working in Linux environment).</description>

      <description>Since last week we have switched our corporate emails from our ISP to Google Apps for Domains. This gives everybody very easy way how to access and share the Calendar and Contacts, provides Web interface that really works - as well as capability to access your emails via POP3. So far I am very happy with it and the feedback I have got from other Thinknostickers was positive (or none, which means everything is likely OK).</description>

      <description>In order to provide HD Video capabilities and to appease content creators, Microsoft went very far in making sure the Vista is not seen as a tool for content piracy. Did they went too far ? What will be the real cost of this contraversial features ?

      <description>As the title says, the Ubuntu is out. Not really because of some technical flaw or missing features (as the FreeNAS, NASLite+ and OpenFiler before), but because of lack of experience and patience on my side. Unlike other distribution which come pre-packed on DVD, Ubuntu installs from a single CD. There are 3 CD variations available: Desktop, which most of the people use and which is likely responsible for Ubuntu fame, Server and Alternative.</description>

      <description>My love affair with OpenFiler did not last very long. After installation finished, I started browser, pointed to URL I was told by the installer and started to configure. The Web admin was OK, nothing really exciting, but functional. The bad surprise came when I was trying to define users - in order to define volumes later. And here came the screen saying:
Please note that Openfiler needs a central directory service</description>

      <description>After spending most Saturday and Sunday fixing, coding and logging bugs, I finally got to moving ahead. Very likely it is about time, because the NSLU2 keeps producing strange sounds
The box has now additional IDE 160 GB IDE disk, which will hold Linux installation as well as &#34;temp&#34; share, which will not be RAID-ed. Sort of staging area for the stuff in flux.
After contemplating for a while which distribution to use - and generally, whether to build more generic Linux server with Samba or more appliance-type box, I went on with trying OpenFiler first.</description>

      <description>I have been living with my Sony eReader for almost a month now and managed to read about two full books. If not the time crush in biometric project, I would have probably read much more than just two books - nevertheless, I do have some real life experience with the device.
First - the claimed battery life of 7500 page turns is BS. I have observed real battery life about 15-20 hours, so unless you manage to turn about 500 pages per hour, it just does not add up.</description>

      <description>I have started to listen the Security Now! podcasts from the very beginning - sometimes in summer 2005. Unlike some news-and-rumours podcasts that sound kind of weird if you listen them month later, this one did not loose a bit of it&#39;s freshness. Even listening the story of Sony Rootkit discovery again was very entertaining. I am now at first &#34;mod-4&#34; Q&amp;amp;A podcast, Number 16.

 Why is this such a big deal ? I am using GMail for both my personal and work stuff. To make sure my work related email appear as coming from company email address, I set the proper From address when composing an email.</description>

      <description>Well, as it looks like, I was prematurely ecstatic about the new open source based NAS server. While the hardware works great, I had not much luck so far with setting up the software on top of that.
My original idea was to use FreeNAS, let it boot and install into USB drive and use all 4 SATA disks in RAID 5 set up by BIOS. It did not work. FreeNAS does not see the RAID5 volume created by BIOS and keeps referring to 4 separate SATA drives.</description>

      <description>If you have digital camera or digital camcorder, you probably have a problem where to store the pictures and video so that they are readily available for viewing and protected against loss caused by hardware failure. How much storage you need depends on how many and how large pictures do you take and how heavy camcorder user you are. In my case, I have switched to shooting RAW on my D70, doing about 2000-4000 shots a year and the camcorder produces about 4-5 GB unprocessed video per hour of recording.</description>

One problem that these tools have is that as soon as your connection goes down, you are done. Game over. Few days ago I have discovered Scrybe, a tool which maybe can address this problem. Unfortunately, I cannot tell from my own experience, because the system is in private Beta and does allow you to register.</description>

      <description>If it ever happens to you that you need to restart old computer which you have not logged on for 2-3 months and you find out you have no clue what the password could be, do not panick. Exactly this happened to me yesterday. Fortunately I have remembered reading something on lifehacker few days ago about bootable CD which contains live Linux distribution with password cracking open source software Ophcrack. It runs from CD only, does not touch your file system, only loads local SAM and tries cracking the hashes.</description>

      <description>With great horror I have discovered that from my 80 GB hardrive in Macbook already over 76 GB was full. Mostly because of the hidden activity of iTunes and silent downloading of new podcast episodes. Especially video podcasts - such as Mac break - are disk heavy, since they are produced in HD - and as result, look remarkably beautiful on the screen.
While cleaning up, I have decided to burn few of my very favorite podcasts to the MP3 CD and keep it in the car.</description>

      <description>I had a discussion few days ago with a friend of mine on blogging. The topic was that as soon as something happens on the Net, thousands and sometimes even more people are writing, posting, discussing and blogging about the very same topic. A sort of information tidal wave that spreads across the cyberspace. Which was according to my friend huge waste of time and energy. Generally, he meant, from a whole community perspective, it makes no sense to write about something unless there is reasonable chance you will be saying something very unique that nobody else will likely say - otherwise it adds no value, just clutters the content by repeating and rephrasing the already said.</description>

I guess everybody is going to write about iPhone - which is OK because it is indeed very interesting gadget and it stole the show. To bad it will be 6 more months until it will be available in the US and (my best hopes) 8-9 months to have it here in Canada.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned before, I am keeping all my bookmarks in del.icio.us account. Thanks to excellent Firefox extension and available bookmarklets, posting new URL&#39;s is very comfortable. After using the del.icio.us for some time, here is few tips how get best of it:
- use the post buttons - they are available for Firefox as well as IE
- post often and tag a lot. Tags are the only way how to search the non-public posts</description>

      <description>I have to admit that I am suffering from severe case of installophobia. Every time I start installation program on Windows, I am very vividly imagining all the terrible things that may happen in next few minutes. Like overwriting some system DLL&#39;s with some old or wrong version which will break half dozen of other programs. Or messing up my registry so badly that I will have have to spend few days of backing up my system data and installing XP from scratch (and inevitably loose something very important in the process).</description>

Here comes the detailed version (saved from Google Notebook):
 Toggle the Hold switch on and off to avoid &#34;hold trap&#34; Press and hold the Menu and Select buttons until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 10 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.</description>

      <description>It was Rod who started this by saying how great it is to replace slow typing with faster speaking and mentioning some kind of magical software package (appropriately named Dragon Naturally Speaking) which does transform your voice to written properly spelled English text with amazing accuracy. I was pretty sceptical, after seeing few years ago similar software from IBM with not-so-great accuracy, and even more recently the famous Vista speech wreckognition.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s extension is one that most people do not know about - and still almost everybody has it installed. The explanation for both is that it is distributed with Firefox, and unless you specifically prevent it&#39;s installation, you will get it. It is DOM Inspector.
Why would you care about something like this ? Unless you make living by creating Web applications, you probably would not. But if you do, it can help you a lot !</description>

      <description>I have got my eReader on 30th December, so after few days of playing with it, here are first impressions. I managed to read one book and played with it quite a bit, but I am still learning.
The quality of the display and &#34;electronic paper&#34; look and feel is great. It actually looks like paper, not like screen. The non-glossy texture surface has same visibility from every angle and it really reads like paper.</description>

      <description>The 2006 was truly amazing year. We have accomplished so much - we have created the West end development centre, brought in and started several projects, completed phase 1 of employee conversion, started benefits program, ESOP program, redefined the company visual presence, grew the business and the company size considerably and created foundation for future growth.
Most important achievemnt is the fun factor - I am again looking forward to go to work - and again since the Montage days the synergy is coming back.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s topic is dealing with sensitive information - such as logins, passwords, PIN numbers, credit card numbers and so on.
Up to last week, I was using the SplashID software to keep everything worth securing secure. I started to use SplashID back in 2001 when I bought the Palm based Sony Clie SJ30 (as replacement for wonderful Palm IIIxe). The Palm based program came with desktop counterpart that allowed editing of entries.</description>

      <description>I have decided to stop using Microsoft Outlook. No, I did not have any major issues with it, no horror stories of crashed, unreadable emails or viruses. As long as you use decent anti-virus (for example this one), switch off automatic loading of images and never do anything stupid such as clicking on an attachment or a link in email, you are reasonably safe. What got me to switch was lack of interoperability between anything non-Windows and Outlook and headaches of synchronization with on-line information.</description>

      <description>In certain sense, people and companies have one things in common. If have been around for few years, you collect, acquire or create very strange collection of tools, platforms, software and data formats. In short, you end up with lots of digital mess. I am planning to make major cleanup and streamlining in 2007 - consolidate the hardware, software, data formats and workflows both at home and at work.
I have read the GTD book and many interesting articles and blogs on how people implement it.</description>

      <description>During over 8 years living on this continent I&#39;ve developed reasonably thick skin in dealing with business calls, unsolicited mailings and other annoyances of aggressive selling. I was pretty sure nothing can make me really upset. Up until yesterday. Thanks to amazing capability of the Direct Energy sales force who does not take No for an answer.
But let&#39;s start from the beginning. About 3 weeks ago I started to get frequent calls from Direct Energy about their flat rate plan.</description>

I mean install on the real hardware, in order to use it as core operating system. I have no feedback yet on how Visual Studio works, but as he found out, his Ant build files he uses to compile and deploy Java programs stopped working - because Vista did not allow to copy Javascript files.</description>

I still do not have it physically, so I cannot put it under the tree. It is coming next week, when my friend who now enjoys the vacation down in the south returns. He was not only very kind to buy one for me too, but he also wrote a wonderfull review which he is going to post on the Net.</description>

      <description>I have discovered recently the nice feature of Wordpress - Dashboard which shows number of visits, but also shows incoming links and search phrases the people used to land on my blog. Sometimes, they provide really interesting and surprising insights. Of course, I do not see who they are or where the visitors are coming from - so no privacy concerns.
Because of my first name (which is btw abreviated form of Miroslav), I am getting some visits from the people interested in the works of Joan Miró - spanish/catalan artist.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, as of previous Sunday I have run out of the backlog in Security Now! episodes, which means that with all three of my favorite podcasts (Twit, Windows Weekly and Security Now!), I am pretty much dependent on their weekly releases. This is a problem, because the sum of 5-7 weekly commutes to work and back (about 15 minutes one way) plus about 40 minutes in a gym every day equals to about 6 hours of required podcast quality content, and the new episodes of three podcasts above cover barely half of it.</description>

      <description>Quite seldom I see something on the net that is elegant, beautiful, and simple - so simple that it becomes obvious. Last time I had this feeling was with iPod&#39;s wheel.
There was lots of excitement about new Vista user interface features. The users who never used / saw OS-X, must love Vista. It is huge improvement over XP - much nicer, cleaner, very good typography, comes very close to Tiger.</description>

      <description>Using PocketPC with Windows is very easy, assumed that you are using Outlook. Synchronization is straightforward, works out of the box. If you are keeping your contacts in other software than Outlook, you can often find 3rd party software that does the synchronization - or at least provides the plugin. The selection of the solutions is fairly large.
On Mac, you are in similar situation if you want to use Palm based PDA.</description>

First stop is always magazines, partially because it is right next to the entrance, partially because it is on the shortest path to Starbucks counter inside Chapters. For many years, there used to be two shelves with computer magazines. Now there is only one.</description>

Google is pushing Internet Explorer 7. Their own version, using new Internet Explorer Administration Kit. It is not really different version - just configured with Google as default search engine and Google toolbar. Nothing that little more experienced user would not do himself. I am not sure how successfull this will be - but I am pretty sure that this was not what Microsoft had in mind how this tools should be used for.</description>

First was traditional Christmas party at Peter&#39;s place. Second one - which I unfortunately missed - was a gettogether of Montage/Allstream alumni.

      <description>As I mentioned yesterday, my expectations regarding Office 2007 were fairly low. I am not a big fan of office application suites and for most of my editing I am using either on-line tools (like Google docs or Writeboard) or Open Office. True, neither of them has the smoothness and fine polish of Microsoft Office 2003, neither has all of it&#39;s features, but - let&#39;s face it - I barely use maybe 10-20% of Word or Excel capabilities anyway.</description>

      <description>Today was a big day in Ottawa Microsoft community. The Congress Centre was hosting large event - simultaneous launch of Windows Vista, Office 2007 and Exchange server 2007. Because I have almost registered about two months ago, I attended the event. The &#34;almost&#34; means that I tried to register right after receiving MSDN Flash email, but many people must have been faster - I was put on waiting list on two of the 3 tracks (Developers and IT Pros) and before I could even try to register for the third track (Business), everything crashed, Web site hang and I have never heard back from them, nor received any email.</description>

Rather than starting Nero on Win-XP notebook, I have decided to learn (finally) how to do it on Mac. It must be simple, intuititive and much easier than on Windows.</description>

I am not going anywere close to movies or entertainment industry with this. There are more than enough sites, blogs and gossip channels out there that look at life of movie stars or singers. I will stay within the world of computers and technology, which has its own heros and celebrities, albeit known in smaller groups.</description>

      <description>According Forrester reseach &#34;.. the Web will fade. It will be replaced by a new software paradigm&#34;. Nobody knows what this new paradigm will be, but these guys are saying that it will be their platform. I found this link from this very interesting two part article Changing Climates for Microsoft and Google, Desktops and Websmaking interesting analogy between Google and AOL business model, browser as a platform and possible return of thick client (&#34;</description>

      <description>I have switched away from using Outlook once again for variety of reasons - as part of my latest attempts to reduce complexity and increase security (more on that later) and went back to Thunderbird/Web based email systems on all Windows machines. Conversion of address books was piece of cake this time, thanks to Plaxo which I use to synchronize Mac and Windows based systems. Nonetheless, I got curious what format does Thunderbird use for address book and this way I have discovered the awkward Mork file format.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s extension is from the area of - surprise surprise - security and privacy. I guess I am getting slightly paranoid from all the security related stuff I am listening to. But I promise I will switch back to &#34;standard&#34; TWIT, MacBreak and Windows Weekly to compensate the security heavy topics. But it certainly true that the more you are aware of what is technically possible, the more hostile Internet you will see .</description>

      <description>I have worked through my listening to the Security Now! podcasts up to middle October now (more specifically up to here) and one remark from Steve Gibson forced me to think very hard: how today&#39;s hard drives encounter hundreds of read errors a day (actually Leo said &#34;hundreds a minute&#34;), but thanks to ECC process and dynamic reallocation of sectors, this is invisible to the user, because:
&#34; .... if a file is damaged because of a bad sector, it can recover that data by recovering the data, either moving it or kind of reformatting the sector underneath it to make it readable again .</description>

      <description>It is now about 1 year since official release of C# 2.0 and .NET framework 2.0. The next version of C# language - the C# 3.0 seems to get more and more attention - in blogs, official channels and MSDN. There is lot of excitement and big expectations - but I have nagging feeling that the general direction of the C# development is not necessary an improvement.

Today I found out that yet another from my friends got a Mac. Great news, Thomas - hope you will enjoy your Macbook Pro as much as myself, Gabo and many others.</description>

      <description>After listening for over week to Security Now! podcast (thanks, Steve, thanks Leo and happy birthday), I&#39;ve decided to actually do something about the security on computers around. I started to scanning my home network using &#34;Shields Up&#34; and was happy to found that the only open port was SSH, exactly as I thought I configured it.
As next step, I followed the advice from this podcast and used my hosts file to block out ads servers and other internet vermins.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s extension is yet another one that somehow works with URL&#39;s aka links. If you now have strange feeling that all extensions in last few days *were* about links, you are right. But realize that links are the most crucial feature of the Web, and therefore extensions dealing with links are really useful.
After you download Linky (the download is very small - only 32 kB), it adds few entries into your context menu.</description>

      <description>I have read somewhere that quotation is safe way how to say something potentially dangerous or controversial without being legally exposed :-). So today I am going to quote an authority in computer security - Steve Gibson on some very interesting Vista related security information.
Steve is doing (together with Leo Laporte) excellent weekly podcast &#34;Security Now!&#34;. It is so great that I have decided to download as many back episodes as I could find on their site and started to listen to them in the chronological order, back from June 2006.</description>

      <description>Linkification 
Sometimes you see a Web page whose creator was lazy and did not wrapped displayed URL into &amp;lt;A href=&#34;...&#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt; tags. In short, you see something like http://www.thinknostic.com/ instead of http://www.thinknostic.com/ (btw, if you have installed Linkify, you will see both as links). As result, you can see the link on the page, but you cannot really click on it. In order to follow the link, you must select the link text, copy and paste it into address bar and press Enter.</description>

      <description>This is for Gabo, Derek, Steve and others who talked to me about podcasts and about which podcasts are worth listening to.
Since I bought Nano2, I spend lot&#39;s of time listening to podcasts. Pretty much all driving time, walking time and time in the gym is spend listening to wide selection of topics and to people producing them.
Here is my current list plus some additional recommendations:

      <guid>https://miroadamy.com/posts/2006-11-27-feotd-session-saver/</guid>
      <description>Today&#39;s extension is about session management. Great news about Firefox is it&#39;s ability to use tabs and have opened many webpages at the same time. This impacts people&#39;s browsing habits - rather than following one path of the links and diving deep inside the Website, you explore many paths concurrently, jumping from one to another, adding more and more tabs at the virtual crossroads. As in real life, when you travel, bad things can happen - what in this case means that your browser may crash, leaving you in the middle of nowhere with no trace of how you have got there and what you have already visited.</description>

      <description>Technically, it was Sunday so rather than working or reading some serious stuff, I have decided to take a long walk (to catch up with lot&#39;s of new podcasts downloaded yesterday) and to surf the net just for fun. Here is some of the interesting discoveries:
There was a rumor on the net that some Indian student in Kerala discovered a way how to store over 450 GB of data on a sheet of paper.</description>

Most of them switches to new edition at midnight, which is 6PM our time. I am doing this for several years already. What is different between now and 2-3 years ago is what I read. While before it were mostly articles written by journalists and news industry professionals, now I read mostly blogs.</description>

But what if the web page is not really what you are interested in, you just want download all files files attached to the page - and there is a *lot* of them.</description>

      <description>I cannot help it, but it is awkward feeling when something that was part of your life, was so omnipresent is announced to be dead and disappear shortly. Exactly this is happening to video tapes and format VHS specifically. The news has been all around the net day or two ago: studio&#39;s stopped after 30 years production and distribution of the VHS media.
It does not seem to so many years ago when VHS was and new and struggling to survive against more technically advanced BetaMax (I still remember how great the BetaMax movies looked).</description>

      <description>This was is out-of order extension (I mean there are several extensions that I use on daily basis and for that reason I planned to mention them before this one) - but it helped tremendously in my BI project, so here it goes.
Live Headers does one thing only and does it well - shows you HTTP headers of a communication between your browser and any Web site. As long as the browser is Firefox - but why would you want to use anything else, right ?</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of the biometric security project, we are using an excellent enterprise-level Wiki Confluence as knowledge repository and main team communication tool. I was not sure at the beginning, how will the Wiki approach work for all the people on the team, mostly because once before I already tried it and had not much success of introducing the idea. It was few years ago and the Wiki engine I used were nowhere in the same league as Confluence, but main problem at that time was probably the users&#39; mindset.</description>

      <description>As mentioned before, thanks to del.icio.us bookmarking site and excellent Firefox plugin with the same name, I have almost perfect solution where to keep and how to organize my bookmarks. In theory, I will never loose anything interesting. Or will I ?
The good news and the bad news about bookmarks is that they are very dynamic. What you&#39;ve stored in your favorites or del.icio.us may disappear without warning and never come back (actually, thank&#39;s to Google caching it is not so bad, but even Google cache will eventually expire).</description>

Step 1: Buy an iPod. Any model will do, I have got Nano 2Gen, 4 GB
Step 2: Subscribe to some good podcasts
Step 3: Listen to a podcasts while taking long walks - outdoors (preferred) or in a fittness studio.
 That&#39;s it. It works great for me. During last four weeks I have digested lots of podcasts, inclusive TWIT (This Week In Tech) netcasts from August 2006 almost up to today.</description>

It the digital pen - amazing piece of machinery, that remembers all you write (up to 40 pages) and allows you to transfer written text to computer. The catch is that you *must* write on special paper, with microscopic marks that help to note the position of the pen.
I was surprise how successful was the CRC software of making some sense from my cat scratches :-).</description>

Currently owned by Yahoo, is Del.icio.us is a one of many social bookmarking tools out. Probably not the one with most features, not the one with coolest user interface - but pretty good one and certainly winner for me.
I have been struggling with the problem of how to keep my collections of URL&#39;s under control for several years.</description>

Being a single parent, even for a short and definite period of time is pretty demanding task.

      <description>It&#39;s official. The Browser version 2 final is out. I mean Firefox, of course - it should be quite obvious what is &#34;the browser&#34; these days. Yes, I know - IE still holds majority of the browser share and yes, Safari is really really nice, fast and good looking application - but let&#39;s face it: browser is not just another application - it is a *platform* these days. Platform means extensibility and extensibility means being a good foundation for add-ons, extensions and plugins.</description>

The project started on Monday and we were running around like crazy since Sunday. Started with moving in looots of boxes - 9 workstations, each with two 19&#34; LCD monitors plus three servers, network gears, cables etc - three full cars. Then came the unpacking and setting up, which took much longer time that I would ever have expected.</description>

      <description>Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don&#39;t improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often.
What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find.</description>

      <description>We will be moving into new office space soon. It is exciting time, stepping from working (mostly) at customer&#39;s locations to own project office. Location is of course Kanata Business Park North, with nice view to a golf course. This location brings several changes against the office in downtown - some of them are great - such as 1) we have lot&#39;s of space and 2) parking is not an issue - arrive any time, park as long as you wish.</description>

      <description>Bruce Byfield has interesting article in Linux.com featuring hands-on comparison of four on-line wordprocessors: specifically ajaxWrite, ThinkFree Online, Writely, and Zoho Writer. I do not 100% agree with all his conclusions, but it&#39;s interesting and worth reading if you are exploring these tools. I am certainly staying with Writely, right now I am using it on daily basis. Combination of WriteRoom for off-line concepts and &#34;thinking phase&#34; of writing and Writely for on-line editing, adding links, etc fits ideally my needs.</description>

      <description>It is hard to imagine - on September 13th it will be 50 years since IBM introduced the very first hard drive.
Since that time technology made quite a progress. Compare for yourself:
1956 - RAMAC drive
 capacity: 5 Megabytes, built from fifty 24&#34; spinning disks weight: about one ton price: $250&#39;000 / year (lease) price per gigabyte: about fifty million dollars  2006 - typical harddrive
 capacity: 500 GB weight: &amp;lt; 1kg price: ~ $300 price per gigabyte: about 60 cents  Amazing, isn&#39;t it ?</description>

      <description>Again, I need to make some space on a shelf and I simply cannot throw away a book ... This time I have decided to reduce my Java bookshelf to allow new (mostly .NET books) come in. No, I am not abandoning Java - but for next 8-12 months I am very likely fully booked in .NET projects, and after that, it will be time to upgrage to new sets of books for Java 1.</description>

      <description>Continuing in Working On-Line Series - see previous post on word processors 
Spreadsheet is after editing text probably second most important business application. Let&#39;s explore what is out there for those of us, who do not want to install Microsoft Office or commit yourself to one particular platform. Most of the spreadsheet try to copy or emulate subset of the features of &#34;de-facto&#34; spreadsheet standard Microsoft Excel

Good starting points for search is (obviously) Google search for &#34;</description>

This Mac thing seems to be quite contagious. Gabo started to seriously considering buying the MacBook, after listening to my happy stories about Great Mac Discoveries. Even Vlad, right now living trough his latest love-affair with Ubuntu Linux was deeply impressed with OS-X after we seeing Expose, Spotlight, PhotoBooth and iPhoto in action.
Next day, after I arrived to the office in the morning, Gabo was already there.</description>

August 13th I have discovered wonderful thing today. I was experimenting with my PocketPC (Toshiba e830) and switched on Bluetooth. Mac discovered the device OK - all I had to do was to follow the wizard Setup Bluetooth device, under Bluetooth menulet (the strange B icon upper right). I have entered the code Mac suggested on PPC and they new about each other.</description>

August 10th That Spotlight thing is just freaking fantastic :-). After few days of work, accumulating some files, emails etc, just for fun I typed Gabo’s last name to Command-Space search box. I did not even finish typing and first results were coming in the result list: all emails exchanged with Gabo, saved chats, text documents and as “best hit” Gabo’s contact card.</description>

August 3rd This is my second day with Mac, writing in TextEdit as I have not installed any other editor (yet). Still learning, do not want to install lot of junk before I find out proper ways how to do things. Time to learn how things are in the Brave New World ….

July 25th - August 2nd After ordering, I received two emails from Apple, confirming the order. It took 3 days until the order finally got shipped from China (where else, of course) on Friday, July 28th and the estimate for delivery was 5-8 business days. I have received the tracking number and was able to track how my Macbook was moving around the globe: starting from Shizou, China on 28th, arriving to USA, Anchorage, Alaska one day later.</description>

      <description>January - July 2006 This is the story of a journey travelled quite often these days. It describes discoveries, joys and frustrations of one long time Windows user learning how to use Mac OS-X. Many have done this before, many have blogged about it.
The reason why I am writing this down is mostly to remember, and as well because I can. One of the assumes uses of the new MacBook was creative writing so I guess I am trying fulfill the promise to myself.</description>

      <description>If you would ask me to pick one technology phenomenon that had the largest impact on and was the most characteristic for the technology during the years 1995-2000, my answer would be “Web, of course”. For the years 2000-2003 I’d vote for eCommerce, online applications and collaboration (like Google, eBay, Amazon and many others). And for the last 3 years, I would definitely pick online communities and blogs.
Blogs are like tsunami that is changing the landscape of online content.</description>

      <description>Since R&amp;amp;K published the The Book, the title above became de-facto standard way how to start anything. Which is one of the two reasons why I used it as title for this very first entry. The second reason is that the friendly folks from to Wordpress.com have created the title and the first blog entry for me.</description>
