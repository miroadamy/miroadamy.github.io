      <description>A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day. &#34;In
English,&#34; he said, &#34;A double negative forms a positive. In some
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a
negative. However, there is no language wherein a double
positive can form a negative.&#34; 
A voice from the back of the room piped up, &#34;Yeah, right.&#34;
