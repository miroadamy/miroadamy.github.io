      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s blog of the day is a special one. It does not deal with cloud, DevOps or distributed systems. The theme of the blog is travel, life of digital nomad and observations on life from a perspective of a smart young woman, working as Online English teacher and travelling a lot while doing so - https://bookandtravel.blog/
What makes this blog dear and interesting to me is that it&amp;rsquo;s author is my daughter Silvia.</description>

Note for my friends who think Catalan is more or less same as Spanish: go for it and translate :-)</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been five years since I started toying with idea to learn first romance language in my collection - despite living in Canada for over 18 years, I never picked up French.
The learning was slow during 2014 and 2015 (just summer school in Spain and Duolingo) - but it accelerated a lot in last 2 years.
Fast forward to now: on Sunday while watching Prime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(film)) we have decided to switch from English to Spanish (with Spanish subtitles) to enjoy the movie better than in original.</description>

      <title>Double negative</title>
      <link>https://miroadamy.com/posts/2007-09-03-double-negative/</link>

      <description>A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day. &#34;In
English,&#34; he said, &#34;A double negative forms a positive. In some
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a
negative. However, there is no language wherein a double
positive can form a negative.&#34; 
A voice from the back of the room piped up, &#34;Yeah, right.&#34;
Found on the Net :-)</description>
