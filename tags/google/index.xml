      <description>Installed Google Wifi - three access points. Finally I have good coverage on both floors of the appartment including the upper terrace and will be able to work at night outside during hot summer nights when temperature does not drop under 25.
The setup was supereasy and iOS app is very well made and gives interesting insights.
Happy.</description>
