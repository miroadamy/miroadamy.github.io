      <title>Native OS-X Docker (Beta) - not quite there yet</title>
      <link>https://miroadamy.com/posts/2016-05-17-docker-osx/</link>

      <description>I was intrigued by convenience of using Docker natively on Mac, without dealing with differences localhost != dockerhost, so I subscribed for Beta and installed it.
Good news 1 It can coexist with previous Docker installation (mostly) - see the note at the end. As long as you do not try to run native Docker and docker-machine at the same time, things coexist.
Good news 2 It works for several images I tried.</description>

      <description>Copy the installation of ACC for respective version from a Linux VM:
The startup script in bin/startClient will fail, because it cannot determine which Java to use to run the app.
It is trying to determine Unix flavour, failing that defaults to Solaris and ends up with invalid settings.
Fix Set the variable JAVA_VM to path to executable command on your system.

      <description>I had to upgrade docker toolbox on Yosemite to get latest docker-compose additions.
After installing the new package, I was not able to connect to docker machine:

      <description>Motivation for this hack is my unwillingness to suffer the pain of using Windows UI just to access BCC, ACC or other ATG tools requiring non command-line interface.
The credit for finding out about approach is blog post by James McOrmond - VPN over SSH - who is using this neat trick from Linux for quite some time.
The software mentioned https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle supposedly works on OS-X, however, it has not been updated for 4-5 years and would not function for me (OS-X Yosemite).</description>

      <description>When git uses less as pager the output of commands like git log disappears from the console screen when you exit from less. This is not convenient in many cases so here is how to fix this.
Just for git commands:
git config --global --replace-all core.pager &amp;#34;less -iXFR&amp;#34; For less globally (including git) - add to .bashrc / .zshrc / etc:
export LESS=-iXFR The options we set for less are:</description>

The plugin is OS-X specific, because the DashDoc is

      <description>Case sensitivity and VirtualBox shared folder Weird but true behaviour:
I have the case sensitive encrypted disk (sparse bundle with HFSX type) mounted in VBox shared folders. All works fine, after VM starts:
touch zz zZ creates two files, both &amp;ldquo;inside VM&amp;rdquo; ~/development/ATG/platform-edc as well as in OS-X.
If the VM is suspended and resumed, it looses the case sensitivity inside the VM.
The command
cd ~/development/ATG/platform-edc touch zz zZ will create just single file.</description>

      <description>I have been experiencing issues with Quicklook (press Space on file in Finder or Pathfinder) for some time: it took several second, sometimes 10-15 to show content of simple 1K large property file.
It turned out that on of the QuickLook plugins, installed originally way back in Leopard and brought ahead with TimeMachine restores could have been the reason: the QLStephen.
For more on that plugin see:
 http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/ https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen  To remove the plugin, go to ~/Library/QuickLook and delete the file (it is the bundle) QLStephen.</description>

      <description>Out of the box Quick View (press Space in Finder) behaviour on unregistered files is not very useful: it shows huge Unix icon instead of content of file.
This is default for files like Makefile or build.gradle
This plugin makes it go away and show text file for all UTIs that are plain text: http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/
Installation:
 open the DMG file copy QLStephen.qlgenerator to /Users/&amp;lt;&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator  That&amp;rsquo;s it.

      <description>Since 2005 when I switched to GMail, I was living in browser. For better or worse, I learn to put up with issues like speed, lack of hotkeys, UI that is not as responsive as it should be, drag and drop that works most of the time. To be fair, in these five years browsers and GMail UI improved tremendously. It was rational decision to trade all these for simplicity of the UI.</description>

      <description>I was happy user of the iWork Suite 08 since I moved to OS-X. It somehow better matches the way I am thinking and does much better job than Office to get me from idea to acceptable looking rendering of that idea in the form of document, spreadsheet or presentation.
In past two month I was involved much more interaction with the requirements, business analysis and project management part of the process.</description>

      <description>In theory, exchanging mainboard on Macbook has no impact because all your data is stored on your harddisk that is untouched. In real life, there are few minor surprises.
First, your MAC address of the network card had changed. This is something you will not notice, unless Murphy&#39;s law plays funny game with you, as it did with me. When arriving back to the office, I was able to connect to WiFi network, but the ethernet was stubbornly getting the &#34;</description>

      <description>Back in November 2007, when I was buying Macbook Pro, I did order the AppleCare option, which added several hundred dollars to already pretty expensive notebook price. For moment I was tempted to go without it - after all, Apple makes top grade, high quality hardware and considering pretty low failure rate I have seen with my Windows based notebooks between 1998-2006, why to pay more ? Little did I know how much mileage will I get from the extra cost :-(.</description>

      <description>Here is the context: in order to upgrade iLife 08 to iLife&#39;09 (which is very nice, btw), I had to install 10.5.6 upgrade. And according Murphy&#39;s law, one of the 2 GB DIMM&#39;s in my MacBook Pro went bad exactly during the OS-X upgrade process.
It had two rather unpleasant consequences:
 some of the patch files got downloaded and saved in corrupted state   The machine did not boot back after restart  The second problem was fixed by replacing the bad DIMM, but the first caused that upgrade to 10.</description>

      <description>I have noticed few of this beauties in Kanata Chapters. Nice replacement for the beaten up CRT terminals that used to be around. They somehow looked right and familiar from the distance.

Beautiful screen, with touch capability.
Nice presentation and user interface.

The keyboard with unique personality.
And after looking closer, it was very obvious why:

Proper keyboard simply must have Command key ;-)
PS:I am sorry for bad quality of pictures - iPhone camera under bad light conditions.</description>

Go to YouTube page and select video you are interested in in Safari. While playing, press Option-Command-A which opens Activity window. Locate the video stream - it will be the largest item in the list.</description>

Form factor of thin screen of size 9-12 inch, with reasonable subset of touch gestures would be EXACTLY what I need from a internet terminal / reader.

      <description>Finally - the new version of Things on iPhone can synchronize with Things on Mac desktop.
It actually works - no strings attached. Assumed that:
1) the WiFi on iPhone is on
2) iPhone and Mac are on same network (so that Bonjour magic can work)
3) the Mac Things is running when you start Things on iPhone
the synchronization happens automatically and is VERY fast (few seconds max).
Finally a portable GTD application that works for me :-).</description>

      <description>A comment got to me via friend mentioning why am I suddenly so negative about Apple and Macs, which quite surprised me. True, I have had some serious hardware issues in first two weeks of June, but this negative event was about as much positive experience as hard disk crash can be.
Thinking back what I have learned and discovered from this:
- Time Machine actually works
- it pays to plug in the firewire disk with Time Machine backups every day - the two second operation saves a lot of time in long run</description>

      <description>So, after few days working diskless, I am back to normal operation mode. About time, we are late with last episode of screencast ...
The copying of external disk went error free and took almost 5 hours (210 GB). Fortunately, the MBP was usable - I did not want to modify too many files, but it was perfect for Web research and writing in Google Docs.
After reboot, the TimeMachine decided that 85 GB needs to be backed up again.</description>

      <description>So, I have positive proof that the file system crash of last week was not a software problem in Leopard, but indeed caused by hardware failure. After restoring system from Time Machine, things looked pretty good - everything seemed to work. I was able to re-render the screencasts I have lost - I mean I have lost converted AVI files and MP4 files, not the &#34;source&#34; MOV files. I worked on Mac over Saturday and Sunday.</description>

      <description>It happened on Wednesday afternoon. I knew something is wrong with my MacBook Pro immediately - when I saw semi-dark screen, unresponsive machine - even mouse cursor was frozen - and heard fans blowing full speed, making the strange, clicking noise coming from inside almost disappear ...
OS-X does not freeze too often, but it can happen and as a matter of fact, I have seen it happen before during my almost two years with Mac, so I did not panic.</description>

      <description>Today I tried for the first time the iDVD 08 with intention to create DVD version of the screencast - just to find out that the application dies right after the start. From the error report (thanks for that) the problem was in missing dependency Oxygene framework - a module similar to Windows DLL. Here is the error message:
[sourcecode language=&#39;xml&#39;]
Link (dyld) error:

      <description>As if the yesterday&#39;s Firmware update issue was not enough, I had very strange experience with iMovie 08. Suddenly, for no obvious particular reason the user interface became very unresponsive, I was not able to select project in project library. Switching Event library and Project windows on or off stopped working. Windows were not redrawn properly. Creating new project had no visible effect. I could not click on project to select it (well, technically I *could* click, but nothing happened).</description>

      <description>as long as you are Safari Books online subscriber - see it here.
Completely updated with XCode 3.x and Objective C 2.0. The screenshots even show the iPhone project templates, indicating the XCode 3.1 in some places. So far the only difference against reality I have found is not covering the XIB resource format (which is generated by default) and sticking with NIB. This blog entry has good explanation of the difference.</description>

Suddenly, for no obvious reason, the top menu became unavailable and cursor changed to beachball every time I moved it there. The Bluetooth mouse stopped responding. Finder stopped responding. All symptoms as if Finder would hanging ...
The cause of the issue was crash of unrelated application (iShowU, if you are curious), which brought up the crash report window.</description>

Some research showed this is known problem - which is from certain point of view good, because many people found hopefully many workarounds. The more information can be found here, here and here.</description>

To be completely fair, I did have experienced an occurrence of something similar twice in last moths: after wake up from sleep, the screen was collection of the color pixels, completely unreadable. After reboot, everything was normal.
I found out that the issue may be related to the &#34;safesleep&#34; mode. For now, I disabled the mode by</description>

I always saw it as less developed, dead-end version of C++ that has little perspective - despite that GCC supported it since early days. I guess I was wrong on two of three counts - that of little perspective still holds as long as you want to stay outside of OS-X platform.
One of the issues I had was strange syntax and that from not too many books on subject, they were</description>

The sale is on for 4 more days. The way how it works is that at certain marks, additional applications will be added to the bundle (for the same price) and will be made available to everybody who purchased the bundle.</description>

      <description>Today I got to trying out the major feature of Leopard: the Time Machine. I was postponing it because I did not have proper external storage. Although I do have several USB disks sized from 100 to 260 GB, they are not empty and to clean them would take too much time that I currently do not have. Backing up on network drive would be technically possible - with some tweaking - but copying over network is always slower than USB2 or FireWire.</description>

The QuickView in Leopard is extensible with plugins. One very obvious and very useful plugin is ZIP View that gives you content of the ZIP file in preview without unzipping it.</description>

The first case was requirement to review an non-trivial Excel file. Normally, Numbers does very decent job when it comes to loading Excel files and for the most the remaining cases, the OpenOffice (in it&#39;s more polished Cocoa version NeoOffice) works just fine.</description>

The productivity in using Java is actually higher, thanks to faster machine and Spaces allowing to have opened few Firefox windows with Spring documentation, terminals for Ant builds, Tomcat, Eclipse and Spype/Adium to keep in touch. Spaces is about as good as having multiple monitors - the ability of switching between both with mouse and keyboard fits well in my working habits.</description>

As result I have ended up with many programs installed that I do not really need or use. Fortunately, the uninstall process is as simple as install and there is no registry that could get corrupted, so it was not really a big deal. With the new one, I am going to be much more selective what I put on the harddrive and what not.</description>

      <description>The combination of 17&#34; screen with Leopard&#39;s visual appeal is pure beauty.
Unlike assumed, the Leopard does NOT (yet) come preinstalled on hard disk. There is a DVD which will install it. I have decided to erase everything and start from scratch. The install took about 45 minutes and had zero problems. The only confusing part was that after erasing harddrive you also erase iLife and need to reinstall it. On the Web site, Apple shows an image of two DVD&#39;s - Leopard and iLife&#39;08.</description>

      <description>Since the big meow on Friday, lot of unhappy people had been talking and blogging about how terrible and unacceptable is the absence of the Java 6 from the Leopard. Some post were sounding very dramatic &#34;I would not buy Mac if I only knew ...&#34; - which is a bit silly. The Leopard&#39;s 300 new features were posted and touted and hyped for two weeks. Some of the &#34;great&#34; improvements were actually fairly modest improvements - so it was OBVIOUS that Java 6 is not going to be included because it would definitely make the list.</description>

      <description>With latest iTunes update, quite silently, a very nice new feature appeared. Apple started to offer for download lectures from many universities, with wide selection of topics: from environment through politics to mathematics and computer science. Most of the lectures are videos, but you will find also audio tracks - albeit for some topics, audio is quite problematic. Can you imagine doing e.g. differential equations in audio-only ?
The best feature - the lectures are free downloads.</description>

      <description>Thanks to exploring the Google calendar (when playing with public calendars related to Ottawa) I found the Ottawa Mac User group&#39;s calendar and discovered that
a) they exist
b) they hold monthly meetings in nice Irish pub at the Market 
The group is actually named Bytown Mac User&#39;s group, for the reasons explained on the Web site or here.
So I decided to go there. I thought - what the heck, worst thing that can happen that I will have a glass of Guinness at the pub I never visited before, which is not a bad thing at all.</description>

      <title>Many ways how to &#34;Get a Mac&#34;</title>

      <description>I found out by accident that the famous Get a Mac ads exists in many versions:
Some nations have their own actors
http://www.apple.com/uk/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/jp/getamac/ads/
Other have only just language version of Long &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Hodgman act
http://www.apple.com/de/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/fr/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/it/getamac/ads/
http://www.apple.com/es/getamac/
The Austria and German speaking part of Switzerland are using German version of the ads (no surprise there) - http://www.apple.com/chde/getamac/ - and the francophone part of Switzerland uses the French version. As it looks like, Italian and Romansch speaking Swiss do not count :-(</description>

      <description>From today&#39;s Steve Jobs&#39; keynote at Macworld 2007:
&#34;I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been. &#34;
Wayne Gretzky
I guess everybody is going to write about iPhone - which is OK because it is indeed very interesting gadget and it stole the show. To bad it will be 6 more months until it will be available in the US and (my best hopes) 8-9 months to have it here in Canada.</description>

      <description>My daughter&#39;s music CD for her skating short program got badly scratched and because it was the last-but-one copy (as skater you need many copies, in case you loose/forget/scratch/misplace it), I was confronted with the task to create a new copy. Rather than starting Nero on Win-XP notebook, I have decided to learn (finally) how to do it on Mac. It must be simple, intuititive and much easier than on Windows.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been almost 5 months now since I started to use Mac OS-X. During these months, I became very comfortable in the new environment and albeit I do not consider being a power user, I can do all I need with my Macbook and use it daily.
Today I found out that yet another from my friends got a Mac. Great news, Thomas - hope you will enjoy your Macbook Pro as much as myself, Gabo and many others.</description>

This Mac thing seems to be quite contagious. Gabo started to seriously considering buying the MacBook, after listening to my happy stories about Great Mac Discoveries. Even Vlad, right now living trough his latest love-affair with Ubuntu Linux was deeply impressed with OS-X after we seeing Expose, Spotlight, PhotoBooth and iPhoto in action.
Next day, after I arrived to the office in the morning, Gabo was already there.</description>
