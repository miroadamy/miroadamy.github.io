      <description>Experience is what you get when you did not get what you wanted.

 Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things.
They are there to stop the people who do not want it badly enough
They are there to stop &#34;the other people&#34;
 Randy Pausch

      <description>Often, scientific &#34;failure&#34; teaches you more than success ... An experiment which gives you a clear answer is not a failure; it can surprise you, though. Failure comes only when an experiment answers no question -- usually because it&#39;s been done with ignorance or sloppiness. The true trick in science is to know what question your experiment is truly asking.

      <title>Epigrams on Programming</title>

      <description>My favorite top ten epigrams, for more see http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html
0. One man&#39;s constant is another man&#39;s variable
1. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
2. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
3. A language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
4. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
5. You can&#39;t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</description>

      <description>Thought of the day:
... Too much to learn. Too much bandwidth crowding the channels of communication. We can’t listen fast enough. We’re left standing on our tiptoes all the time
 Greg Bear, The Darwin&#39;s Radio
This does not sound very optimistic, which is quite representative. I am down with bad headache, cannot really think straight, spending time sleeping, reading a book (above) and surfing the Web.
I found out that I made it to Ottawa Blogger&#39;s list and learned a new word: splogger</description>
