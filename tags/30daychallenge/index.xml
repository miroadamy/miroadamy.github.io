      <description>Time to make checkpoint number 1 - it is day 11 of 30.
So far - out of this 11 days I have 10 days with commits. The missing day was fully dedicated to working on presentation and documentation, that unfortunately ends up Confluence and Google Doc, not in some proper textual format (read: Markdown or RestructuredText) backed by a repository.
Stuff that I worked on:
 some minor updates to resume (added AWS badges, fixed some typos) notes from certification courses + code fragments scripts for automation of documents / ebooks backup from iCloud to local drives  Most commits went to documentation / practice code for my project &amp;ldquo;Many ways to Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; where I play with building up K8s clusters using different approaches.</description>

      <description>My work in last few years took my away from practical coding towards DevOps. Despite the increased role of IaaC in our DevOps, this often means living in iTerm and AWS console with interaction not being captured in any form.
On writing side, lots of my output shifted from code towards writing text in Wiki&amp;rsquo;s, GoogleDocs and more and more in Slack messages. The code I write are short one-liners or small scripts with very short life span.</description>
