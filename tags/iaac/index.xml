      <description>Many shapes of Architecture According to the wise people, an architecture is the shared understanding that the expert developers/system builders/maintainers have of the system design. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to maximize the probability that the decisions you have to make early in a project are the right ones. It is sort of a blueprint for the future system and captures parts, relations, boundaries, constraints.
In our business (we build and run environments and solutions for eCommerce, data management and other business activities of our customers), an important subtype of architecture is Reference Architecture.</description>

      <description>First step is to get your personal token. Log on to Terraform Cloud, go to https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens and generate new token.
Note: it is important to save the token to safe place - this is only time you will see it.
Export the token:
export TFE_TOKEN=&amp;lt;THE-TOKEN-VALUE&amp;gt; The documentation for Terraform API is here
It is OK documentation but not the greatest one, however. There are two versions of the API - v1 and v2 and this is not clearly described.</description>
