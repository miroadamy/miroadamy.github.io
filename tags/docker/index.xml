      <description>I have just returned from DockerCon Europe 2018 and I’d like to share my impressions while they are fresh in my mind. It was my first DockerCon so I was not quite sure what to expect. As the title says, it was great experience and barring the scaling issue (more below) could have been really awesome experience.
But let&amp;rsquo;s take things in order. First location - Barcelona. Hard to pick better place in December than Spain.</description>

      <description>I had to upgrade docker toolbox on Yosemite to get latest docker-compose additions.
After installing the new package, I was not able to connect to docker machine:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  ➜ ~ docker-machine status Stopped ➜ ~ docker-machine start default Starting &amp;#34;default&amp;#34;... (default) Check network to re-create if needed... (default) Waiting for an IP... Machine &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; was started.</description>
