      <description>I have just returned from DockerCon Europe 2018 and Iâ€™d like to share my impressions while they are fresh in my mind. It was my first DockerCon so I was not quite sure what to expect. As the title says, it was great experience and barring the scaling issue (more below) could have been really awesome experience.
But let&amp;rsquo;s take things in order. First location - Barcelona. Hard to pick better place in December than Spain.</description>
