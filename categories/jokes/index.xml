      <title>Double negative</title>

      <description>A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day. &#34;In
English,&#34; he said, &#34;A double negative forms a positive. In some
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a
negative. However, there is no language wherein a double
positive can form a negative.&#34; 
A voice from the back of the room piped up, &#34;Yeah, right.&#34;
Found on the Net :-)</description>

      <description>Few of my favorites:
Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. [Alan Kay]
Hofstadter&#39;s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#39;s Law.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</description>
