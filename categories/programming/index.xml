      <description>Question from email:  how do I merge 1 file from master -&amp;gt; LIVE
 Answer You cannot. Merge operation creates new commit that has 2 or more parents and will always join full histories of the branches.
You can however:
 replicate all changes done in single commit to different branch - this is &amp;ldquo;cherry pick&amp;rdquo; take state of single file from different branch into current branch  How to replicate all changes done in single commit to different branch - &amp;ldquo;cherry pick&amp;rdquo; Say you have latest commit in master that contains change to two files you need.</description>

      <description>Show branches and tags in log  git log &amp;ndash;oneline &amp;ndash;decorate
 Even better - all branches with graph  git log &amp;ndash;oneline &amp;ndash;decorate &amp;ndash;all &amp;ndash;graph
 Highlight words instead of lines  git diff &amp;ndash;word-diff HEAD~~~ HEAD~~
 Also works in git log -p and git show
Better status  git status -sb
 Compare with gs == git status

      <description>Got it working. It is a bit rough around the edges, but functional.
The two components
 http://localhost:8080/dyn/admin/nucleus/thinkwrap/twatg/script/GroovyDemoScript/ http://localhost:8080/dyn/admin/nucleus/thinkwrap/twatg/script/GroovyScriptRunner/  The are not started via Initial, but that is not a problem.
The script tested:
class ThatsGroovyDude implements com.thinkwrap.twatg.script.RunnableScript { atg.nucleus.Nucleus nuc = atg.nucleus.Nucleus.getGlobalNucleus(); public String run() { String s = &amp;#34;&amp;#34;; nuc.configPathNames.each { s += &amp;#34;${it}\n&amp;#34; } return &amp;#34;Hello World!\n\n&amp;#34; + s; } } </description>

Sublime Text This is easy - there is DashDoc plugin - https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/DashDoc
The plugin is OS-X specific, because the DashDoc is

      <description>Brief description of my latest setup I use for CPL and LCH - in case I forget it or somebody wants to replicate it.
Inspiration for the setup came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=cPt_1Vga-Nk
Motivation - issues with VMs VMs are great - they allow &amp;ldquo;packaged&amp;rdquo; dev environment and quick start for the new member of the team. Start a VM on local or remote host, connect with VNC or Remote Desktop and you are in business.</description>

      <description>I was merging the branch that removed / consolidated bunch of duplicate JSP files (corporate-ui-cleanup).
In the meantime in master, some minor UI changes were made to these files whose content was now elsewhere.
Quick trick how to resolve it fast:
Show branch CineplexB2B $ git show-branch ! [bb-database-cleanup] Loading data with XML only: no constraints and tax_id (unused field) nullable ! [bb-gradle-build] Merge branch &amp;#39;master&amp;#39; into bb-gradle-build * [bb-master] Merged in the last 5 days changes !</description>

      <description>Suddenly I started to see all apps auf Deutsch:
The cause was by mistake selecting additional language in Properties -&amp;gt; Internationalization (Österreichisches Deutsch) and the system added it to the list as language #1.
Those programs that are localized, picked it up &amp;hellip;.
Here is how that list looks like after reorder :-) I care only for the first 11 languages anyway ;-)</description>

      <description>I have been experiencing issues with Quicklook (press Space on file in Finder or Pathfinder) for some time: it took several second, sometimes 10-15 to show content of simple 1K large property file.
It turned out that on of the QuickLook plugins, installed originally way back in Leopard and brought ahead with TimeMachine restores could have been the reason: the QLStephen.
For more on that plugin see:
 http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/ https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen  To remove the plugin, go to ~/Library/QuickLook and delete the file (it is the bundle) QLStephen.</description>

      <description>Finally a todo/task/project management system that is very good fit.
Here is why:
 is pretty visually modern and dynamic UI has Web back-end (usable from Linux VM) has decent iPhone app allows checklists (multiple) allows color coding Markdown support ecosystem  There is Gmello that allows create card from GMail, plus few others that seem to bridge the gap between Evernote, System XYZ and Trello

      <description>OK, NERDTree plugin IS great, but this is awesome.
Alloy made custom version of MacVim with file drawer: see https://github.com/alloy/macvim/wiki/Building
It is available in source - so you have to compile it yourselves. But if you do not want to, I did it and the binary is attached, built with these features:
 ./configure &amp;ndash;with-feature=huge &amp;ndash;enable-rubyinterp &amp;ndash;enable-pythoninterp &amp;ndash;enable-perlinterp &amp;ndash;enable-cscope
 Archive is attached: MacVim.zip
If you want to get my set of plugins and customizations, it is on GitHub: - https://github.</description>

      <description>After I created the ThinkWrap GitHub account and uploaded the public key, this key got somehow bound to GitHub identity &amp;lsquo;madamy&amp;rsquo;
I had to add user madamy to my public GitHub repo - where I keep the dot-files - https://github.com/radegast/dotvim
This may be an issue for people that have their own private accounts - the key management is the key.

      <title>How to make unregistered files work in Quick View on OS-X</title>

      <guid>https://miroadamy.com/posts/2012-04-08-quickview/</guid>
      <description>Out of the box Quick View (press Space in Finder) behaviour on unregistered files is not very useful: it shows huge Unix icon instead of content of file.
This is default for files like Makefile or build.gradle
This plugin makes it go away and show text file for all UTIs that are plain text: http://whomwah.github.com/qlstephen/
Installation:
 open the DMG file copy QLStephen.qlgenerator to /Users/&amp;lt;&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;/Library/QuickLook/QLStephen.qlgenerator  That&amp;rsquo;s it.
Now it looks like this:</description>

      <description>Few gitbits to remember Pushing new local branch to remote repo: Find a ref that matches experimental in the source repository (most likely, it would findrefs/heads/experimental), and update the same ref (e.g. refs/heads/experimental) in origin repository with it.
If experimental did not exist remotely, it would be created.
git push origin experimental
This is the same as:
git push origin experimental:refs/heads/experimental
Create the branch experimental in the origin repository by copying the current experimental branch.</description>

      <description>Part of the beauty of JSP development is the easy of trying out the change. All you have to do is edit the JSP file, save it and reload the page. Yesterday I got caught by surprise by not being able to do exactly that. I saw some strange behaviour in an EL expression used JSP tag. As it was nothing ATG specific, I decided to try it out in plain old Tomcat rather than full ATG application.</description>

      <description>I have been Cultured Code customer for over 2 years and used multiple their products: Things on OS-X, Things for iPad and iPhone on daily basis.
Not any more.
I am definitely giving up on Things and Cultured Code products.
The reason why is sheer frustration from long wait on usable synchronization between Things on Mac, iPad and iPhone. Something that have been discussed, promised, chewed over 2 years and that still does not work.</description>

For better or worse, I learn to put up with issues like speed, lack of hotkeys, UI that is not as responsive as it should be, drag and drop that works most of the time. To be fair, in these five years browsers and GMail UI improved tremendously. It was rational decision to trade all these for simplicity of the UI.</description>

I listen to a lot of podcasts, about 50 % of them produced by Leo Laporte&#39;s TWIT Network (This Week in Tech, Macbreak, This Week in Google, FLOSS Weekly and occasional Security Now).
What I like about Leo&#39;s network is professionalism of audio production, usually good and interesting panel with topics that are worth listening to.</description>

      <description>You know the drill: open browser, new tab, type &#39;www.facebook.com&#39; and in moment you can see who of your online buddies is up to something interesting. This is exactly what I did. Only I did not end up in well known Facebook page, but on something really fishy:
This is definitely NOT facebook. How come I ended up on &#39;quiz.us&#39; site when I typed in www.facebook.com. Or did I ? Let&#39;s do it again:</description>

      <description>I was happy user of the iWork Suite 08 since I moved to OS-X. It somehow better matches the way I am thinking and does much better job than Office to get me from idea to acceptable looking rendering of that idea in the form of document, spreadsheet or presentation.
In past two month I was involved much more interaction with the requirements, business analysis and project management part of the process.</description>

      <description>I first time discovered Ruby back in 2006 (yes, I know, I was late to the game), and immediately fell in love with it. The dynamic nature of the language, the consistency, pure esthaetics and practicality certainly changed the way how I saw software development and programming languages.
Since that time, I made several attempts to integrate Ruby into my professional life and make it part of the toolbox. It was cool to play with Ruby in my spare time, but I wanted to use it on projects whose main development language/platform was mainly Java.</description>

Now when the site has been announced and mentioned few times in the media, I guess it&#39;s OK to mention it here too.

      <description>Here is the context: in order to upgrade iLife 08 to iLife&#39;09 (which is very nice, btw), I had to install 10.5.6 upgrade. And according Murphy&#39;s law, one of the 2 GB DIMM&#39;s in my MacBook Pro went bad exactly during the OS-X upgrade process.
It had two rather unpleasant consequences:
 some of the patch files got downloaded and saved in corrupted state   The machine did not boot back after restart  The second problem was fixed by replacing the bad DIMM, but the first caused that upgrade to 10.</description>

      <description>Since few weeks we have started internally use an interesting microblogging tool named Yammer. It works very similarly to Twitter, which means that you are posting very short posts, focusing on the stuff you are doing or working on. Unlike with Twitter, Yammer is company oriented and your posts will be visible ONLY to the recipients that share your company&#39;s email address.
Yammer is free service with interesting business model: everybody can join your company&#39;s network (if that person has proper email address), but to gain administrative rights, you have to pay dollar a month per user.</description>

After some googling around and experimenting (this link was most helpful to point me in correct direction) I found solution that worked for me.
All I had to do was to disable Floppy Drive in the System applet of Control panel. After this, the conversion continued and right now is squeezing 100 GB disk into 50 2 GB files on external USB disk.</description>

      <description>A wonderful gem I found here:
I remember telling a friend
that being a project manager
is a little like being a bouncer:
where there&#39;s a problem *here*
and a door *there*
and it&#39;s your job to get the problem out the door.
So
For some a gentle gesture will do
while others need a push
and still others need to be picked up by their pants and carried

      <description>It is always a nice surprise to find something that is free and actually useful on the Net :-). Like this one: a fellow Ottawan Karl Sequin wrote and generously made available as free download &#34;Foundations of programming&#34; eBook.
He touches many topics of various levels from high level design concepts (dependency injection) to low level &#34;Back to Basics&#34; - how memory allocation and pointers work. Especially the later is often neglected and overlooked (and consequently misunderstood) by younger developers who started their education with a garbage collected language such as Java or C# and never were exposed to beauty and horrors of C ;-)</description>

The timining was pretty ironical, considering the recent contraversy about SpringSource Entreprise Maintenance policy change. The was a heated discussion on TheServerside.com and even FAQ was compiled by Rod Johnson to explain the whole thing.
So what is the issue: SpringSource, commercial entity behind community driven Spring Framework decided to capitalize on the investment and push the community toward paid service suport contract.</description>

      <description>One feature that I strongly miss from Objective C are namespaces. Inability to avoid name clash between your classes sometimes really stands in your way.
I am reading S. Kochan&#39;s book &#34;Programming in Objective C&#34; and in one of the examples he creates the class Point. Unfortunately, there already is struct Point defined in mactypes.h.
The solution is easy - rename the darn Point to something like TKPoint ... at least that is what Cocoa naming guide recommends.</description>

For example - the JBoss log files and nohup.out, ATG log files, and so on - so that the testers can see what happened on server side when something looks fishy on front end.
One option would be to write a document that contails IP&amp;rsquo;s of the machines, create user accounts, make sure that they have just enough access rights to see the files but not disturb anything else &amp;hellip;</description>

The count of updates for AppStore applications is pretty chaotic. You can see different number of updates when looking into different parts of iTunes. I have noticed this cycle repeating for 9 updates, then 8 and so on - here is how it looked when I got down to 3 un-updated apps after few rounds.</description>

Suddenly, for no obvious particular reason the user interface became very unresponsive, I was not able to select project in project library. Switching Event library and Project windows on or off stopped working. Windows were not redrawn properly. Creating new project had no visible effect. I could not click on project to select it (well, technically I *could* click, but nothing happened).</description>

Completely updated with XCode 3.x and Objective C 2.0. The screenshots even show the iPhone project templates, indicating the XCode 3.1 in some places. So far the only difference against reality I have found is not covering the XIB resource format (which is generated by default) and sticking with NIB. This blog entry has good explanation of the difference.</description>

On rare occasions I do not work on my notebook, it is quite useful to have free alternative that allows to create a diagram that does not look too awful, without going through the hoops of downloading and installing software. The bubl.us is exactly that tool.</description>

The cause of the issue was crash of unrelated application (iShowU, if you are curious), which brought up the crash report window.</description>

      <description>Introducing code review and pair programming has often an impact on relationships in the team - especially when a critique needs to be delivered. It takes great degree of experience on both sides to communicate defects in the code for both the reviewer as well as for the code author to get something useful out of it.

      <description>Spam has always been a big problem for all blogs. Fortunately, worpress.com provides wonderfull Akismet spam filter which is works amazingly well. I do have switched on moderation for all comments, to make sure no spam gets through, but without Akismet it would be impossible to manage it because of the spam volume. Since I started this blog (August 2006), it caught over 17&#39;000 (yes, seventeen thousands) spam posts. In other words, about 30 spam comments a day or almost 60 spam comments per published post.</description>

The trigger was need for creating good data set for testing changes in a full text search. I had to locate few hundred of obsolete technical documents to be used as test data, dump the metadata as well as the BLOB data to disc, create INSERT sql scripts and loader that would from Ant pre-load the database with the test set and insert the BLOB&#39;s.</description>

      <description>I have first time encountered the error:
ORA-29907: found duplicate labels in primary invocations
after testing the change request we have implemented recently. The error message was not very helpful - I was not exactly sure which labels and which invocations ;-) - and as Oracle guru who actually does understand fine details of Oracle Text was visiting sunny India, I was on my own.
The change addressed an issue in repository search: users were asking for more flexible processing of full text search phrases: instead of e.</description>

      <description>After some break, I got back to Rails land. The return is not as smooth as I hoped: since Rails 2.0, many things work differently and quite a few steps learned from &#34;The Book&#34; do not work any more. The issues are more often than not quite easy to fix, but there is quite a few of them.
All the following is related to NetbeansRuby build 6327 from Jan 26th with JRuby 1.</description>

      <description>After some break, I dusted off the Ruby to try out one interesting idea Peter presented yesterday that literally ASKS for Rails. So I grabbed the latest and greatest RubyNetBeans from Ruby Hudson. For some reason it stopped updates on January 26th so the latest version I have got was build 6327. It is bundled with JRuby 1.1RC1 and the Rails version that comes preinstalled is 1.2.6. Using the menu Tools -&amp;gt; Ruby Gems, they can be easily upgraded to latest and greatest 2.</description>

      <description>Lured by the iPhone platform, this is what I read in the evenings. Feels kind of funny: after 10+ years of Java/C# and almost as many years of C++ beforehand, I mostly lost my C instincts and C habits. Fortunately, I have also mostly lost my C++ bad habits as well.
The Apple site is definitive starting point - put the http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/index.html into your bookmarks. From non-Apple sources, very bookmarking-worthy is the Cocoa Literature and Cocoa Devcentral.</description>

It addresses the issue how to easily tell which version of the Web application is running as well make sure that the same version is reflected in the snapshots performed by Ant. We have used this approach on several applications and found it quite useful.
The version I talk about is not the automatically generated version from VCS system (such as SVN revision).</description>

      <description>Testing applications that communicate using email is more challenging than e.g. testing database access. Thanks to GMail and Spring, it can be done pretty easily.
Here is the scoop: I need to generate email notifying users about business events and after sending the email, store the content in the database. In real environment you will use corporate SMTP server and real email addresses of real people.
For development we can avoid bothering and spamming our customers by few simple tricks.</description>

      <description>Part of the configuration magic is (one of several) Spring post-processors, that allows load the property file or files and refer to the values in these files inside XML configuration files. The rationale behind these is that property files are much easier to edit that possibly huge XML config file and using property values prevents repeating same value over and over again. With this approach, the following configuration:

      <description>If you work with Oracle database, a very good tool you should not ignore is the Oracle SQL Developer. It gives you much more power when it comes to manipulating data or managing database. I use most of the time MyEclipseIDE plugins, but when I need e.g. export data, the SQLDeveloper is way to go.
Today I tried it for first time on the Mac. I started to configure and database connection and was completely confused by the error message &#34;</description>

Same as in previous project, it has been so much fun :-). So much fun in fact, that I was spending my evening playing with code and reading up what is new in 2.5, rather that blogging ;-)
I am still amazed about how nice is the whole thing designed and how many ways it can be used.</description>

      <description>This one took some time to figure out - it is one of those problems that are obvious after you know the solution but hard to see beforehand.
I had the ResourceBundleViewResolver configured with Tiles 2, like this:
[code language=&#39;xml&#39;]
[/code]
and the view.properties was:
[code language=&#39;xml&#39;]
parent-view.(class)=org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView
parent-view.(abstract)=true
about.url=https://miroadamy.com/WEB-INF/jsp/about.jsp
form.url=https://miroadamy.com/WEB-INF/jsp/form.jsp
list.url=https://miroadamy.com/WEB-INF/jsp/list.jsp
[/code]
It kept givin exception saying that /WEB-INF/jsp/list.jsp does not exist. Which it did. I tried couple of things, no result.</description>

Data layer of the current project is based on iBatis and Spring DAO. We have decided to try out the Abator tool from Apache (part of the iBatis suite) to generate initial version of data mapping (as we inherited the database schema).</description>

      <description>I am experimenting in JRuby and use database in virtual machine (VMWare Fusion). This is great because you can have multiple versions of multiple databases ready without polluting the notebook. One downsize though is that IP address of the database will change between the VM restarts.
First important setting in Fusion is to use the &#39;NAT&#39; option rather than &#39;Bridged&#39;. With NAT, you database host IP address will not follow the network.</description>

      <description>in case you have not noticed - Interface21 aka SpringSource (great name change, btw) runs a blog with lots of hidden treasures inside.
Recent article describes new addition to Spring portfolio which is territory within my &#34;watched space&#34;: enterprise integration. See the blog entry for more.
If you are in corporate space that is keen on &#34;standards&#34;, the comparison of Spring vs EJB3 is very good article as well. Not that EJB would matter too much these days (IMHO) - but a nice read nevertheless.</description>

I always saw it as less developed, dead-end version of C++ that has little perspective - despite that GCC supported it since early days.

What (in my mind) should be smooth and straightforward process was something very different. I should have been forewarned warned after seeing the discussion ... To make long story short, the installer failed on three different Linux VM&#39;s I had available - because of unavailable dependencies, too small swap space etc, etc.</description>

The first case was requirement to review an non-trivial Excel file. Normally, Numbers does very decent job when it comes to loading Excel files and for the most the remaining cases, the OpenOffice (in it&#39;s more polished Cocoa version NeoOffice) works just fine.</description>

As result I have ended up with many programs installed that I do not really need or use. Fortunately, the uninstall process is as simple as install and there is no registry that could get corrupted, so it was not really a big deal. With the new one, I am going to be much more selective what I put on the harddrive and what not.</description>

      <description>Since the big meow on Friday, lot of unhappy people had been talking and blogging about how terrible and unacceptable is the absence of the Java 6 from the Leopard. Some post were sounding very dramatic &#34;I would not buy Mac if I only knew ...&#34; - which is a bit silly. The Leopard&#39;s 300 new features were posted and touted and hyped for two weeks. Some of the &#34;great&#34; improvements were actually fairly modest improvements - so it was OBVIOUS that Java 6 is not going to be included because it would definitely make the list.</description>

      <description>Many good posts about programming, coding, business, aesthetics, with nice touch of wisdom, If you are into programming languages, do not miss this one, this and this. If you are more into process and management, try this and this or this. There also deeper and lighter stuff :-)
As Reg says about popular bloposts
One model for popular writing is that it panders to the reader&#39;s prejudices. Plain and simple. People like writing that validates them and especially their ideas.</description>

      <description>Every software developer will tell you how frustrating it is to trace problem in your application up to the point of third party library call (jar file or .dll / .so - make your choice) - and then have to resort to trial and error exploration, because you have no source code for that particular library module. For this very reason, most developers always prefer working with libraries or toolkits that comes with source code attached - if they have a choice.</description>

      <description>Can you imagine a database table with 25000 (twenty five thousands) columns ? No, not rows, COLUMNS ! Now if you can do that, can you imagine displaying these columns in a datagrid (spreadsheet) on a screen ?
This is exactly what this guy is describing to be his requirements. I hope he did misunderstood or misread the requirements, because displaying 25000 columns on a screen is not only impossible - it is absolutely useless.</description>

      <description>There is - after all - a Petstore implementation for Ruby. Somebody asked a question at the DZone and the response posted by Raphael Valyi was:
Re: Is there a Pet Store in Grails/Rails? I&#39;m speaking here for the Rails (JRuby) side:
there is actually a petstore, it can be found there:

      <description>According to the TIOBE Programming Community index (which gives an indication of the popularity of programming languages), Ruby jumped 3 places and made it to top ten. Congratulations !
If you look closely on the trends down on the page, the dynamically languages popularity has risen over 3.6% during year period. Which is A Good Thing (TM).
Should I make my personal Top Ten of the programming languages, ordering languages by my degree of comfort of using the language, the language beauty (which is, in the eye of the beholder ;-)).</description>

      <description>As part of current project I need to test some ORM frameworks and for that, you need a database. In this particular case, database equals Oracle. I need a local instance to be able to work outside of the customer&#39;s location.
On my notebook, I have already installation of MySQL (for all the Rails stuff) and SQLServer (for ASP.NET). Plus few lightweight databases (meaning that they do not really need a server) such as sqlite3, Derby and HSQLDB).</description>

      <description>If you try to deploy one of the Spring 2 samples included in the Spring framework source distribution - Petclinic on Tomcat 6 (6.0.14), the web application does not get loaded and fails with errror. The cause is the ClassNotFound exception for the class org.springframework.instrument.classloading.tomcat.TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader, more precisely:

SEVERE: LifecycleException
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.instrument.classloading.tomcat.TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader

      <description>Part of the technology upgrade in the three Java based projects is also tool update. We have started with Eclipse version 1 and gradually moved up to the currently used Eclipse 3.0. The build and deployment process was based on custom written Ant build script, which compiled, created WAR, deployed, undeployed, run the tests, created source snapshot - you name it. The Eclipse was used mostly as editor and debugger - using JPDA talking to Tomcat started in debug mode.</description>

      <description>During my recent return to Javaland, I have noticed many improvements in newer releases of well established frameworks and toolkits, as well as many new ones. One such new release is version 2 of Spring framework. It is not really a hot news, because the final version of 2.0 is out for almost a year (October 2006), but it is new to me, because I spend pretty much all of last 12 months in DotNet, C# and OLAP worlds, with only brief visits to older Struts based, Spring-free Java projects.</description>

      <description>Hi, all Java gurus inside and outside of Thinknostic - I have a very interesting problem. Imagine the following situation: we have three existing Java Web applications, written back in 2000/2001, based on open source libraries of that time: Struts 0.9/1.0 and JSP 1.x (no JSTL) with Tiles for Web layer, Apache Torque for ORM, early version of Quartz for job scheduling, Jasper Reports for PDF reports and Freemarker as template engine for email creation.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been over 10 months since we have started to seriously use virtualization and run Windows inside virtual machine to ease installation and configuration pain. It starting first as convenient measure of isolation two different development environments (.NET 1.1 based and .NET 2.0 based) and avoid &#34;crosspolination&#34; in the data analytics project. At that time, my expectations what would be the limits of what you can or cannot do in virtual environment were mostly around performance, responsiveness and device support (USB especially).</description>

      <description>go and get it - at http://www.ghisler.com/
It got nice visual upgrades - look and feel and icons are gently nicer and more XP-ish. Plus many other new features. Upgrade is still free for registered users.
If I should pick one single most useful program I ever used on any computer system, Total Commander would be clear winner. I do not remember when exactly I purchased the license - I guess sometimes around 1994-95, when it was named Windows Commander.</description>

It is pretty tough question to answer. The way this books tries to address it is following the story not very well known open source project named Chandler through it&#39;s beginning over period of 3 years.</description>

      <description>An interesting article on JavaLobby caught my eye today: Do .NET Applications Run Better on Java?

Normally, knowing the not exactly impartial focus of the Java centric site such as JavaLobby or theserverside.com, one should be careful when reading how much Java outperforms .NET. The bias works the other way too - just look at the Theserverside.net or other .NET centric side how much is C# superior :-). With that in mind, I looked atthe technical report.</description>

Unlike before, it is so much easier to have really good debugger that allows put breakpoints not only into the Ruby code in controllers and model - but even into the RHTML view files !
Netbeans team works hard on improving the tool. With latest build - 2434, I have noticed great addition - Rails console.</description>

Unlike some other screencasts who try to record the screen action as MPEG movie, this one is perfectly legible. In addition to the Rails enlightenment, you can also enjoy the speed and aesthetics of using TextMate - with many great Ruby editing shortcuts and beautiful OS-X typography.</description>

      <description>It has been quite some time since I used a Swing based Java application. Compared to beauty and close-to-native feeling of Eclipse based application, Swing just did not feel right - it looked differently and behaved a bit differently. For long time, my desktop was Swing-free (not counting the JDK demo). Not any more, though.
What made me to reconsider, is new release of the Netbeans v 6. In the latest milestone builds (M6 to M9), Netbeans team built amazing Ruby development environment.</description>

      <description>There has been lots of interesting news related to Microsof and Ruby recently, mostly about DLR&#39;s support of dynamic languages. One of my favorite tech authors stirred the waters once again last Friday with an article that goes beyond this and tries to paint larger picture of the uneasy relation between Ruby platform, Agile movement, OpenSource Community and Microsoft.
One quote from the article:
The attitude to open-source is a large part of this problem.</description>

      <description>The support for using dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python to code ASP.NET pages was announced for future versions of ASP.NET in the ASP.NET futures.
Unless I am mistaken, it means that we eventually will be able to write control event handlers in Python or even Ruby - which is certainly more fun than in VB.NET or even in C#, but is it really so important ?

      <description>I found a handy T-SQL trick that helped to solve the following problem: during datawarehouse creation, we needed to consolidate multiple data sources from databases belonging to two generations of system: older one using int identity keys, the newer one, designed for replication and distributed data scenarios using GUID&#39;s as primary keys.
In the consolidated database, we needed to create single representation that would allow to store both new GUID based identities as well as old int-based keys.</description>

      <description>Imagine if somebody got copyright on a number 32. You could not say any more on a Web page that you use 32 bit OS because you were not allowed to use the number. You could not even write thirty two, or 0x20... Could not send a card for 32nd birthday. Sounds crazy, right ?
But exactly this is happening. Somebody is trying to claim exclusive ownership of one number and sending take-down letters, law threats to those you have it posted on their web sites or blogs.</description>

      <description>I had again the not-so infrequent pleasure of setting up fresh copy of Windows development stack. We were moving few machines between projects and to make sure that no forgotten source files are left on the harddisk, we reformatted and reinstalled Windows from scratch. It is usually good idea anyway, because developers like to install strange tools and utilities and generally customize machines to their own taste, which tend to be unique and is seldom shared.</description>

      <description>at least as the programming language languages are concerned. One of the things that will be presented on the MIX07 is Dynamic Language Runtime, a new platform suitable to host high level, dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby. For Python, there is already pretty decent .NET implementation - namely IronPython. What is coming now is IronPython 2.0 based on the DLR as well as - yesss - IronRuby.
It is great that this is happening.</description>

      <description>The natural gravity of our environment keeps pulling me out of scripting and Ruby world back to .Net zone :-). Out of curiosity, I looked into how easy or hard is it to access other database from Ruby, than the default MySQL which dominates all books, samples and tutorials.
I have found three ways (at least), one likely platform independent and two Windows only. The platform independent requires module ADO.rb and works with the DBI interface.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve ever envied the ability of multilingual friends to bridge language gaps wherever they travel or gained new appreciation for your native language by learning a new one, then you can probably see the advantage of being a programming language polyglot. Developer polyglots travel the IT world more freely than do monolinguists (sure that they can apply their skills in any environment), and they also tend to better appreciate the programming language called home, because among other things they know the roots from which that home is sprung.</description>

      <description>As it happens, both my most favorite podcasters - Leo Laporte as well as Steve Gibson are passionate e-book readers. They have both purchased and are (mostly) happy users of the Sony PRS-500 aka Sony Reader in addition to several other platforms - (Palm, Pocket PC). In the latest podcasts - both in TWIT as well as Security Now!, the eBooks and eReader got quite some publicity :-).
Both had similar experience with PDF format on PRS-500 as myself - but Steve mentioned the PDF re-flowing the document to make it better suites for small screen - something I have looked into but did not get it working quite right.</description>

      <description>(a followup to discussion last week)

In every outsourced software project you have four large areas: your customer, the business vertical you are writing software for, your implementation team and the technology foundation or platform you are using.
Two of these areas are on &#34;internal&#34; side of your organization (team and technology), two of them are on external - your customer side (business domain and customer organization). Two are more micro level in the sense that they have strong human interaction aspect (customer and team) and two are more macrolevel and less personal (business domain and technology).</description>

      <description>This week was full with attending the demos and workshops. On Tuesday, I spent half day on the Microsoft Unify Tour 2007. I planned to be there full day but an important business meeting made me change the plan. Fortunately, the sessions should be available recorded on the Web, so I will be able to check them later. The topic was bang-on - considering that we are in final phase of large project, using distributed network of SQL Server 2005 installations with replication and location was same as usual.</description>

      <description>This was one great weekend ! Easter should be more often than once a year, I guess. Unlike Christmas, there was no shopping craziness before and much less overeating danger. Not counting overdose of chocolate, of course, but that&#39;s OK.
I managed do mostly nothing for about one day - up to Friday evening. Then I dived into the Ruby and Ruby on Rails world. After reading this and one third of this book, I like Ruby even more.</description>

      <description>.NET 2.0 offers very rich and nicely designed library of core data structures, collections and algorithms. Occasionaly, you run into situation when you need something not in there. Before starting to design you very own extension of LinkedList or HashTable, look into interesting open-source project NGenerics - chances are you will find it there.
It contains quite a few new data structures:

      <description>I guess it is too early to write any more systematic opinion about the language you know less than 10 days, but after reading the Programming Ruby 2nd edition (thank you, Safari Books) I have found out that I actually do like couple of Ruby features a lot. Your mileage may vary - what speaks here is my Java/C#/C++/C/Python/Perl background and bias. Here there are my favorite Ruby-isms (so far) in no particular order:</description>

      <description>Today I have started the walking season 2007. I did some gentle preparation during the week - few short, 4-5 km strolls around the neighbourhood, but it was today when I really started. It was beautiful day in Ottawa - sunny, temperature around 8-10, so I took off and did 12 km loop through Westboro, down south and around Dow&#39;s Lake up to downtown. Just fantastic. The companion on the road were Security Now!</description>

      <description>Man lernt nie aus - as the German say - one never stops learning. Thanks to comment found on my blog I found out that there is very nice solution problem of disappearing emails (after you download it with one POP client, other POP client would not get it). It is even documented in GMail help:
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=47948&amp;amp;topic=1556If you&#39;re accessing your Gmail using POP from multiple clients, Gmail&#39;s recent mode makes sure that all messages are made available to each client, rather than only to the first client to access new mail.</description>

      <description>As Murphy said - you cannot do just one thing. Thanks to JDK 1.4 entering end-of-life support period (and 1.3 being unsupported for some time), we need to move few applications happily running on these antique Java platforms to at least Java 5 and gain few more years of uninterrupted Sun-supported life.
Upgrading the applications was as expected, piece of cake - as long as you have solid build environment with build scripts and everything - which we certainly do.</description>

One of our old customers asked us to do few enhancements and changes in the application we wrote. And because we always stand behind our work, always do answer the call for help and do support our customers as long as they want to be supported, I have squeezed-in few days worth of work into pretty packed schedule.</description>

      <description>There are few technical books which you enjoy first time you read them, remember the experience and keep coming back. One of such classic books is The Pragmatic Programmer - from journeyman to master - by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. If you have not read it, get it, it is worth every cent. Since the book was written - ages ago, back in 2000 - it did not loose anything of its freshness and value - which one cannot say about most of technical books written earlier than 2-3 years ago.</description>

      <description>Since yesterday, I made nice progress in solving my issues with content creation for PRS500 and it&#39;s readability. There are several ways how to proceed:
The simplest is to download Book Designer. It is free for non-commercial use and current version 5.0 Alpha does the job very well. It allows you to load source in text, HTML, Lit, PDF, PalmDoc (prd/prc), rb and few other formats and process them into native LRF format - plus few others I do not really care about.</description>

      <description>My favorite top ten epigrams, for more see http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html
0. One man&#39;s constant is another man&#39;s variable
1. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
2. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
3. A language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
4. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
5. You can&#39;t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</description>

Usual location - Glacier Room at downtown Microsoft Office. I decided to attend for two reasons: first was that I knew the presenter - David Campbell. David is a great guy - consultant with 20 years of history in the software development business, running his own company. Last year when we were looking for people with CSLA experience in Ottawa, David&#39;s name came out first.</description>

Who in sanemind would bother typing and writing code when can GUI do it all. The convenience rules. If you need to add or change something, it takes just few more clicks. Not a big deal, just add a few more easy steps. No problem - right ?</description>

      <description>It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. [Alan Cooper]
And the users exclaimed with a laugh and a taunt: &#34;It&#39;s just what we asked for but not what we want.&#34;
For a sucessful technology, honesty must take precedence over public relations for nature cannot be fooled.</description>

&#34;I have fixed that bug, do you want me to compile it too ?&#34;.
 In his mind, he was done as soon as he identified the bug and put the fix in the code. All the rest was trivial and unimportant routine.
During last 20 years I have worked with many very different developers and learned the hard way, how very many different meanings the word &#34;</description>

 Ch-7: Digging into the source code
In this chapter, Mike describes the tools that work with, around or towards source code: Idlasm, Reflector and FxCop. The book is written for Visual Studio 2003, so some references are slightly outdated - but there is one utility that stands out and is still more useful than ever: Lutz Roeder&#39;s Reflector. It is part of the Visual Studio 2005 (albeit in older version that you can get on the Web site).</description>

It was probably one of the best presentations I have seen in Microsoft Glacier Room on 100 Queen Street. I am not sure whether because it was indeed so great or because it touches closely what we are doing.</description>

Various magazines, publishers and companies do present theirs yearly list of Best Products, but they are often biased and seldom representative. The one list that stands apart and that in my opinion comes closest the Oscar is Jolt Awards published by used-to-be one of the best magazines for professional programmers - Dr Dobbs Journal.</description>

      <description>Webbit is like timbit - it comes in 12, 20 or 40 pack, contains many small pieces of different taste and color, is generally unhealthy but good, can be addictive and is nice addition to your morning &#34;extra large, double cream&#34; from Tim Hortons. Unlike from timbits, from webbits you will not get fat, only distracted. Enjoy !

      <description>Thanks to Lifehacker I have discovered this extension which add missing piece of GMail functionality:  This very simple extension allows you to enter multiple sets of text (such as e-mail signatures) and paste them into forms simply by right-clicking.
 Why is this such a big deal ? I am using GMail for both my personal and work stuff. To make sure my work related email appear as coming from company email address, I set the proper From address when composing an email.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s extension is one that most people do not know about - and still almost everybody has it installed. The explanation for both is that it is distributed with Firefox, and unless you specifically prevent it&#39;s installation, you will get it. It is DOM Inspector.
Why would you care about something like this ? Unless you make living by creating Web applications, you probably would not. But if you do, it can help you a lot !</description>

      <description>I had a brief MSN chat with friend of mine today, who tried to install and use Vista as development platform. I mean install on the real hardware, in order to use it as core operating system. I have no feedback yet on how Visual Studio works, but as he found out, his Ant build files he uses to compile and deploy Java programs stopped working - because Vista did not allow to copy Javascript files.</description>

      <description>According Forrester reseach &#34;.. the Web will fade. It will be replaced by a new software paradigm&#34;. Nobody knows what this new paradigm will be, but these guys are saying that it will be their platform. I found this link from this very interesting two part article Changing Climates for Microsoft and Google, Desktops and Websmaking interesting analogy between Google and AOL business model, browser as a platform and possible return of thick client (&#34;</description>

      <description>I have switched away from using Outlook once again for variety of reasons - as part of my latest attempts to reduce complexity and increase security (more on that later) and went back to Thunderbird/Web based email systems on all Windows machines. Conversion of address books was piece of cake this time, thanks to Plaxo which I use to synchronize Mac and Windows based systems. Nonetheless, I got curious what format does Thunderbird use for address book and this way I have discovered the awkward Mork file format.</description>

      <description>It is now about 1 year since official release of C# 2.0 and .NET framework 2.0. The next version of C# language - the C# 3.0 seems to get more and more attention - in blogs, official channels and MSDN. There is lot of excitement and big expectations - but I have nagging feeling that the general direction of the C# development is not necessary an improvement.
The main new features of the C# 3.</description>
