      <description>My favorite top ten epigrams, for more see http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html
0. One man&#39;s constant is another man&#39;s variable
1. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
2. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
3. A language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
4. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
5. You can&#39;t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.</description>
